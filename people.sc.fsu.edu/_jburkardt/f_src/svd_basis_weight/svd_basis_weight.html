      SVD_BASIS_WEIGHT<br> Extract singular vectors from weighted data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SVD_BASIS_WEIGHT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      applies the
      singular value decomposition ("SVD") to a set of weighted data vectors,
      to extract the leading "modes" of the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      This procedure, originally devised by Karl Pearson, has arisen
      repeatedly in a variety of fields, and hence is known under
      various names, including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the Hotelling transform;
        </li>
        <li>
          the discrete Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT)
        </li>
        <li>
          Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        </li>
        <li>
          Principal Orthogonal Direction (POD)
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
        </li>
        <li>
          Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The role of the weights is to assign greater importance to some
      vectors.  This will have the effect of making it more likely
      that modes associated with such input data will reappear in the
      output basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is intended as an intermediate application, in
      the following situation:
      <ol>
        <li>
          a "high fidelity" or "high resolution" PDE solver is used
          to determine many (say <b>N</b> = 500) solutions of a discretized
          PDE at various times, or parameter values.  Each solution
          may be regarded as an <b>M</b> vector.  Typically, each solution
          involves an <b>M</b> by <b>M</b> linear system, greatly reduced in
          complexity because of bandedness or sparsity.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user determines a weight vector W, with one value assigned
          to each solution or vector.  Depending on the problem, the
          weights might be chosen beforehand, or computed automatically
          by some natural system, perhaps related to a varying time step
          size, or other reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          This program is applied to extract <b>L</b> dominant modes from
          the <b>N</b> weighted solutions.  This is done using the
          singular value decomposition of the <b>M</b> by <b>N</b> matrix,
          each of whose columns is one of the original solution vectors after
          scaling by the weight vector.
        </li>
        <li>
          a "reduced order model" program may then attempt to solve
          a discretized version of the PDE, using the <b>L</b> dominant
          modes as basis vectors.  Typically, this means that a dense
          <b>L</b> by<b>L</b> linear system will be involved.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the program might read in 500 solution files, and a weight file,
      and write out 5 or 10 files of the corresponding size and "shape",
      representing the dominant solution modes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The optional normalization step involves computing the average
      of all the solution vectors and subtracting that average from
      each solution.  In this case, the average vector is treated as
      a special "mode 0", and also written out to a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute the singular value decomposition, we first construct
      the <b>M</b> by <b>N</b> matrix <b>A</b> using the individual
      solution vectors as columns (after multiplication by the weights
      (w1, w2, ..., wN):
      <blockquote><b>
        A = [ w1 * X1 | w2 * X2 | ... | wN * XN ]
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The singular value decomposition has the form:
      <blockquote><b>
        A = U * S * V'
      </b></blockquote>
      and is determined using the DGESVD routine from the linear algebra
      package <a href = "../lapack/lapack.html">LAPACK</a>.
      The leading <b>L</b> columns of the orthogonal <b>M</b> by <b>M</b>
      matrix <b>U</b>, associated with the largest singular values <b>S</b>,
      are chosen to form the basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      In most PDE's, the solution vector has some structure; perhaps
      there are 100 nodes, and at each node the solution has perhaps
      4 components (horizontal and vertical velocity, pressure, and
      temperature, say).  While the solution is therefore a vector
      of length 400, it's more natural to think of it as a sort of
      table of 100 items, each with 4 components.  You can use that
      idea to organize your solution data files; in other words, your
      data files can each have 100 lines, containing 4 values on each line.
      As long as every line has the same number of values, and every
      data file has the same form, the program can figure out what's
      going on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program assumes that each solution vector is stored in a separate
      data file and that the files are numbered consecutively, such as
      <i>data01.txt</i>, <i>data02,txt</i>, ...  In a data file, comments
      (beginning  with '#") and blank lines are allowed.  Except for
      comment lines, each line of the file is assumed to represent all
      the component values of the solution at a particular node.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, for instance, is one data file for a problem with just
      3 nodes, and 4 solution components at each node:
      <pre>
      #  This is solution file number 1
      #
        1   2   3   4
        5   6   7   8
        9  10  11  12
      </pre>
      As far as the program is concerned, this file contains a vector
      of length 12, the first data item.  Presumably, many more files
      will be supplied.
    </p>

    <p>
      A separate file must be supplied for the weights, with one weight
      for each data item.  The magnitude of the weight is important, but
      the sign is meaningless.  For a set of 500 data vectors, the weight
      file might have 500 lines of text (ignoring comments) such as:
      <pre>
        # weight file
        #
        0.15
        0.50
        1.25
        0.01
        1.95
        ...
        0.77
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is interactive, but requires only a very small
      amount of input:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>L</b>, the number of basis vectors to be extracted from the data;
        </li>
        <li>
          the name of the first input data file in the first set.
        </li>
        <li>
          the name of the first input data file in the second set, if any.
          (you are allowed to define a master data set composed of several
          groups of files, each consisting of a sequence of consecutive
          file names)
        </li>
        <li>
          a BLANK line, when there are no more sets of data to be added.
        </li>
        <li>
          the name of the WEIGHT file.
        </li>
        <li>
          "Y" if the vectors should be averaged, the average subtracted
          from all vectors, and the average written out as an extra
          "mode 0" vector;
        </li>
        <li>
          "Y" if the output files may include some initial comment lines,
          which will be indicated by initial "#" characters.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program computes <b>L</b> basis vectors,
      and writes each one to a separate file, starting with <i>svd_001.txt</i>,
      <i>svd_002.txt</i> and so on.  The basis vectors are written with the
      same component and node structure that was encountered on the
      solution files.  Each vector will have unit Euclidean norm.
