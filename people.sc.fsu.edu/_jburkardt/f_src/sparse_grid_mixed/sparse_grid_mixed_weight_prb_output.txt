SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_WEIGHT_TESTS
  Call SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_WEIGHT_TEST with various arguments.
  All tests will use a point equality tolerance of   0.222045E-15
 
SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_WEIGHT_TEST:
  Compute the weights of a sparse grid.
 
  Each sparse grid is of spatial dimension DIM_NUM,
  and is made up of product grids of levels up to LEVEL_MAX.
