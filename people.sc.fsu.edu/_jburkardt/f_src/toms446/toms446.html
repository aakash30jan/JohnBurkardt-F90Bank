    <p>
      <b>TOMS446</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      implements ACM TOMS algorithm 446, for the manipulation
      of Chebyshev series,
      by Roger Broucke.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the text of many ACM TOMS algorithms is available online
      through ACM:
              <a href = "http://www.acm.org/pubs/calgo/">
                         http://www.acm.org/pubs/calgo</a>
      or NETLIB:
      <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/toms/index.html">
      http://www.netlib.org/toms/index.html</a>, most of the early
      algorithms are not available.  This is one of them.  I typed it
      in.
