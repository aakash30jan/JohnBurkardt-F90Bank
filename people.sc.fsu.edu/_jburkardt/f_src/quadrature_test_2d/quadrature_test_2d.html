      QUADRATURE_TEST_2D <br> Quadrature Rule Applied to 2D Test Integrals
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUADRATURE_TEST_2D</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads three files that define
      a 2D quadrature rule, applies the quadrature rule to a set of
      test integrals, and reports the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quadrature rule is defined by three text files:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>the "X" file</i> lists the abscissas (N rows, M columns);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>the "W" file</i> lists the weights (N rows);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>the "R" file</i> lists the integration region corners
          (2 rows, M columns);
        </li>
      </ol>
      For more on quadrature rules, see the <b>QUADRATURE_RULES</b>
      listing below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The test integrals come from the <b>TEST_INT_2D</b> library.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>quadrature_test_2d</b> <i>prefix</i>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <i>prefix</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the common prefix for the files containing the abscissa (X),
          weight (W) and region (R) information of the quadrature rule;
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the arguments are not supplied on the command line, the
      program will prompt for them.
