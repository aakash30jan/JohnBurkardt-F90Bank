      CCVT_REFLECT <br> Interior + Boundary CVT
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CCVT_REFLECT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      creates a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation
      of N points in an M-dimensional region, in which points are
      also placed along the boundary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The standard CVT algorithm will tend to place points uniformly
      inside the region, but will never place points <i>on</i> the boundary.
      However, in many cases, it would be very desirable to smoothly
      modify the set of points so that some of them fall on the boundary.
      This is the case, for instance, when the points are to be used to
      triangulate the region and define a finite element grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method for doing this relies on the observation that the
      generator points become uniformly distributed because they
      "push" each other away, by grabbing sample points.  The generator
      points do not approach the boundary too closely, because there
      are no sample points on the other side of the boundary.  In essence,
      the boundary also "pushes" the generator points away.
      By making "reflected" sample points whenever a generator is near
      the boundary, we essentially neutralize the boundary effect, allowing
      the generator points in the interior to push a layer of generators
      onto the boundary.  In most cases, once a point hits the boundary,
      it will not leave, although it may continue to adjust its position
      on the boundary itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        This program was a "work in progress", until progress was halted.
        So a number of ideas were started, and only some completed.
        For the program as it stands now, only a simple 2D box region
        has been examined.  A next logical step would be to work on
        more general 2D regions; then to make the natural extension to
        3D or arbitrary dimension.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      CCVT_REFLECT is an experimental code; so far, the experiment
      is not doing well.  I haven't figured out yet how to make the
      points behave as well as they do for <b>CCVT_BOX</b>.  The idea is,
      though, that the method of pulling points to the boundary seems
      fairly natural and flexible to me, so maybe I just need to
      find the right way to implement it.
