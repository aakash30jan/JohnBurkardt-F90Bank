      FD1D_HEAT_EXPLICIT <br> 
      Finite Difference Solution of the<br> 
      Time Dependent 1D Heat Equation<br>
      using Explicit Time Stepping
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_HEAT_EXPLICIT</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 library which 
      solves the time-dependent 1D heat equation, using the finite difference
      method in space, and an explicit version of the method of lines to handle
      integration in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program solves
      <pre>
        dUdT - k * d2UdX2 = F(X,T)
      </pre>
      over the interval [A,B] with boundary conditions
      <pre>
        U(A,T) = UA(T),
        U(B,T) = UB(T),
      </pre>
      over the time interval [T0,T1] with initial conditions
      <pre>
        U(X,T0) = U0(X)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A second order finite difference is used to approximate the
      second derivative in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solver applies an
      explicit forward Euler approximation to the first derivative in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resulting finite difference form can be written as
      <pre>
       U(X,T+dt) - U(X,T)                  ( U(X-dx,T) - 2 U(X,T) + U(X+dx,T) )
       ------------------  = F(X,T) + k *  ------------------------------------
                dt                                   dx * dx
      </pre>
      or, assuming we have solved for all values of U at time T, we have
      <pre>
       U(X,T+dt) = U(X,T) 
                 + dt * ( F(X,T) 
                          + k * ( U(X-dx,T) - 2 U(X,T) + U(X+dx,T) ) / dx / dx )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Other approaches would involve a fully implicit backward Euler approximation or
      the Crank-Nicholson approximation.  These latter two methods have
      improved stability.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second worthwhile change would be to replace the constant 
      heat conductivity <b>K</b> by a function <b>K(X,T)</b>.  The
      spatial variation would allow for the modeling of a region
      divided into subregions of different materials.
