    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FOOTBALL</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      ranks college football teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      A sample file of scores is available from
      Knuth's Stanford Graph Base.  The program reads this file, computes
      a scoring matrix, and determines a ranking.  At the moment, only
      some of Keener's methods have been implemented.

      LADDERS</a>,
      a C program which
      seeks to transform one five letter word into another, by changing
      one letter at a time, using only legitimate English words.  This
      puzzle was invented by Lewis Carroll, who called it "Doublets", but
      it is also known as "Word Ladders" or "Word Gold".  The program 
      is by Donald Knuth.
