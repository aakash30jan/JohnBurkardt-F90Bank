LCVT_DATASET (FORTRAN90 version)
  Generate a Latinized CVT dataset.
 
  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.
 
  The program requests input values from the user:
 
  * DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * SEED_INIT, a seed to use for random number generation,
  * INIT, initialize the points:
    ** file, read data from a file;
    ** GRID, by picking points from a grid;
    ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
    ** RANDOM, using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
    ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
    ** USER, call the "user" routine;
  * CVT_IT_NUM, the maximum number of CVT iterations.
  * SAMPLE, how to conduct the sampling.
    ** GRID, by picking points from a grid;
    ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
    ** RANDOM, using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
    ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
    ** USER, call the "user" routine;
  * SAMPLE_NUM, the number of sample points.
  * BATCH, number of sample points to create at one time.
  * LAT_IT_NUM, the number of Latinizing iterations.
  * OUTPUT, a file in which to store the data.
 
  To indicate that no further computations are 
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value, 
  such as -1.

*  Ready to generate a new dataset:

  Enter DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try "2" if you do not have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input DIM_NUM =            2
 
  Enter N, the number of points to generate:
  (Try "25" if you do not have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input N =           85
 
  Enter SEED_INIT, a seed for the random number generator:
  (Try "123456789" if you do not have a preference.)
  (Any negative value terminates execution).
  User input SEED_INIT =    123456789
 
  INIT is the method of initializing the data:
 
  file     read data from a file;
  GRID     by picking points from a grid;
  HALTON   from a Halton sequence;
  RANDOM   using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
  UNIFORM  using a simple uniform RNG;
  USER     call the "user" routine;
 
  (Try "RANDOM" if you do not have a preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
 
  Enter INIT:
  User input INIT = "UNIFORM".
 
  CVT_IT_NUM is the number of CVT iterations.
 
  A CVT iteration carries out the following steps:
  * the Voronoi region associated with each
    generator is estimated by sampling;
  * the centroid of each Voronoi region is estimated.
  * the generator is replaced by the centroid.
 
  If "enough" sampling points are used,
  and "enough" iterations are taken, this process
  will converge.
 
  (Try "50" if you do not have a preference.)
  (A negative value terminates execution).
 
  Enter CVT_IT_NUM:
  User input CVT_IT_NUM =     40
 
  SAMPLE is the method of sampling the region:
 
  GRID     by picking points from a grid;
  HALTON   from a Halton sequence;
  RANDOM   using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
  UNIFORM  using a simple uniform RNG;
  USER     call the "user" routine;
 
  (Try "RANDOM" if you do not have a preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
 
  Enter SAMPLE:
  User input INIT = "UNIFORM".
 
  SAMPLE_NUM is the number of sample points for CVT.
 
  The Voronoi regions will be explored by generating
  SAMPLE_NUM points.  For each sample point, the
  nearest generator is found.  Using more points
  gives a better estimate of these regions.
 
  SAMPLE_NUM should be much larger than N, the
  number of generators.
 
  (Try "10000" if you do not have a preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)
 
  Enter SAMPLE_NUM:
  User input SAMPLE_NUM =        10000
 
  BATCH is the number of sample points to create
  at one time.
 
  BATCH should be between 1 and SAMPLE_NUM.
 
  It is FASTER to set BATCH to SAMPLE_NUM;
  setting BATCH to 1 requires the least memory.
 
  (Try         1000 if you do not have a preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)
 
  Enter BATCH:
  User input BATCH =         1000
 
  LAT_IT_NUM is the number of Latinizing iterations.
 
  Each step of the latinizing iteration begins
  by carrying out CVT_IT_NUM steps of CVT iteration,
  after which the data is "latinized".
 
  Often, one latinizing step is enough.
 
  In some cases, it may be worth while to carry
  out several latinizing steps; that is, the
  Latinized data is smoothed by another series
  of CVT steps, then latinized, and so on.
 
  (Try "1" if you do not have a preference.)
  (A negative value terminates execution).
 
  Enter LAT_IT_NUM:
  User input LAT_IT_NUM =      5
 
  OUTPUT is the name of a file into which
  the computed data may be stored.
 
  (Try "lcvt.txt" if you do not have a preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
 
  Enter OUTPUT:
  User input OUTPUT = "lcvt01.txt".
