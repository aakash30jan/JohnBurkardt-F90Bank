    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LINPACK_Q</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      implements some of the LINPACK library of linear solvers,
      using quadruple precision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quadruple precision real variables are declared by using a 
      <b>selected_real_kind()</b> statement first: 
      <pre>
  integer, parameter :: qp = selected_real_kind ( 33, 4931 )
      </pre>
      after which, variables may be declared by statements like
      <pre>
  real ( kind = qp ) x(*)
      </pre>
      Constants that need more than single precision should
      include the "Q" marker:
      <pre>
        pi = 3.1415925....(lots of digits)....762Q+00
      </pre>
      or else the value will be truncated to single precision,
      one of Fortran's unnecessary, unnoticeable defects
      that has been zealously preserved through decades.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your compiler doesn't support the requested quadruple precision
      arithmetic, then qp is returned as -1, and your code will not compile.
