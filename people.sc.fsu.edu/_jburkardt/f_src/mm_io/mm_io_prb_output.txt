MM_IO_PRB:
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the MM_IO library.
 
TEST01:
  MM_HEADER_READ reads the header line of
    a Matrix Market file.
  MM_SIZE_READ_FILE or MM_SIZE_READ_STRING
    reads the size line of a Matrix Market file.
 
  Reading "matrix_05_05_crg.txt".
 
MM_HEADER_PRINT:
  Header information from Matrix Market file "matrix_05_05_crg.txt".
 
  Matrix Market ID = "%%MatrixMarket".
    "%%MatrixMarket" is only allowed value.
 
  Matrix Market TYPE = "matrix".
    "matrix" is only allowed value.
 
  Representation type REP = "coordinate".
    "coordinate" for sparse matrices,
    "array"      for dense matrices,
    "elemental"  for unassembled finite element matrices.
 
  Numeric FIELD = "real".
    "integer" for integer values,
    "real"    for real values,
    "double"  for double precision real values,
    "complex" for complex values,
    "pattern" for nonzero pattern only.
 
  Symmetry type SYMM = "general".
    "general"         no symmetry,
    "symmetric"       A(I,J) = A(J,I),
                      input only lower triangle.
    "skew-symmetric"  A(I,J) = - A(J,I),
                      input only strict lower triangle.
    "Hermitian"       A(I,J) = A*(J,I),
                      input only lower triangle.

TEST03:
  MM_FILE_WRITE writes the header and data of
  a Matrix Market file.
 
TEST04:
  MM_FILE_WRITE writes the header and data of

  In this example, we generate the Wathen matrix
  of order 29 x 29, and store it (inefficiently)
  as an array.
