      BVLS <br> Bounded Variable Least Squares Solver
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BVLS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      solves a least squares problem with bounds on the variables,
      by Charles Lawson and Richard Hanson.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given an M by N matrix, A, and an M-vector, B, BVLS computes an
      N-vector X that solves the least-squares problem:
      <blockquote>
        A * X = B<br>
        subject to BND(1,J) &lt;= X(J) &lt;= BND(2,J) for 1 &lt;= J &lt;= N.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program allows the user to bound some or all of the variables.
      The user is also free to constrain some variables with only a one-sided
      bounded.  The values BND(1,J) = -huge(ONE) and BND(2,J) = huge(ONE) are
      suggested choices to designate that there is no constraint in that
      direction.  The parameter ONE is 1.0 in the working precision.
    </p>

    <p>
      This algorithm is a generalization of the routine NNLS, which solves
      the least-squares problem:
      <blockquote>
        A * X = B<br>
        subject to 0 &lt;= X(J) for all J.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The subroutine NNLS appeared in 'Solving Least Squares Problems'
      by Lawson and Hanson, Prentice-Hall, 1974.  Work on BVLS was started
      by Charles Lawson and Richard Hanson at Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
      1973 June 12.  Many modifications were subsequently made.
    </p>

    <p>
      This FORTRAN90 version was completed in April 1995 by Richard Hanson.
      Assumed shape arrays, automatic arrays, array operations, internal
      subroutines and FORTRAN90 elemental functions are used.  Comments are
      prefixed with an exclamation mark.  More than 72 characters appear on 
      some lines.  The BVLS package is an additional item for the reprinting 
      of the book by SIAM Publications and the distribution of the code package
      using netlib and Internet or network facilities.
