      TASK_DIVISION <br> Divide T Tasks Among P Processors
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TASK_DIVISION</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      implements a simple procedure for smoothly dividing T tasks among
      P processors; such a method can be useful in MPI and other parallel
      environments, particularly when T is not an exact multiple of P,
      and when the processors can be indexed starting from 0 or from 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we have 16 tasks and 8 processors, it's easy to see that each processor
      gets two tasks, and that processor 3 gets tasks 5 and 6...(unless we
      index our processors starting at 0 rather than 1, but let's ignore that
      possibility for the moment.)
    </p>

    <p>
      If we have 17 tasks and 8 processors, then we can just give the last processor
      the extra task, because someone has to do it.  But if we have 18 tasks, we
      shouldn't given everyone else 2 tasks, and the last processor 4 tasks.  A
      better assignment would have two of the processors working on 3 tasks, the
      rest on 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, we'd like to do this kind of assignment in a regular enough 
      nonarbitrary way, so that any processor, knowning just its processor index
      and the number of tasks, can work out the number of tasks it got assigned,
      and even the indices of those tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The TASK_DIVISION library outlines a simple way to do this, which is essentially
      a "greedy" algorithm that cuts up the "task pie" a slice at a time, using rounding
      to give each processor about the same number of tasks, in a way that avoids having
      leftovers.
