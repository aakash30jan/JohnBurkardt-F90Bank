      PRIME_MPI <br> Count Primes Using MPI
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PRIME_MPI</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      counts the number of primes between 1 and N,
      using MPI to carry out the calculation in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm is completely naive.  For each integer I, it simply checks
      whether any smaller J evenly divides it.  The total amount of work
      for a given N is thus roughly proportional to 1/2*N^2.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is mainly a starting point for investigations into
      parallelization.
