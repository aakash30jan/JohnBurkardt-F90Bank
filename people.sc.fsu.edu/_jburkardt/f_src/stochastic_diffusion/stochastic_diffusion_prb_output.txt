STOCHASTIC_DIFFUSION_PRB
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the STOCHASTIC_DIFFUSION library.

BNT_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_BNT.

  The first plot uses uniform random values for OMEGA.
  The second uses Gaussian (normal) random values.
 
  Created graphics data file "bnt_data.txt".
  Created graphics command file "bnt_commands.txt".

ELMAN_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_ELMAN.
