!
!! R8CB_NP_FA factors an R8CB matrix by Gaussian elimination.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The R8CB storage format is appropriate for a compact banded matrix.
!    It is assumed that the matrix has lower and upper bandwidths ML and MU,
!    respectively.  The matrix is stored in a way similar to that used
!    by LINPACK and LAPACK for a general banded matrix, except that in
!    this mode, no extra rows are set aside for possible fillin during pivoting.
!    Thus, this storage mode is suitable if you do not intend to factor
!    the matrix, or if you can guarantee that the matrix can be factored
!    without pivoting.
!
!    R8CB_NP_FA is a version of the LINPACK routine R8GBFA, modifed to use
!    no pivoting, and to be applied to the R8CB compressed band matrix storage
!    format.  It will fail if the matrix is singular, or if any zero
!    pivot is encountered.
!
!    If R8CB_NP_FA successfully factors the matrix, R8CB_NP_SL may be called
!    to solve linear systems involving the matrix.
!
!    The matrix is stored in a compact version of LINPACK general
!    band storage, which does not include the fill-in entires.
!    The following program segment will store the entries of a banded
!    matrix in the compact format used by this routine:
!
!      m = mu+1
!      do j = 1, n
!        i1 = max ( 1, j - mu )
!        i2 = min ( n, j + ml )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! R8CBB_ADD adds a value to an entry of an R8CBB matrix.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The R8CBB storage format is for a compressed border banded matrix.  
!    Such a matrix has the logical form:
!
!      A1 | A2
!      ---+---
!      A3 | A4
!
!    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
!    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
!    respectively.  
!
!    The R8CBB format is the same as the R8BB format, except that the banded
!    matrix A1 is stored in compressed band form rather than standard
!    banded form.  In other words, we do not include the extra room
!    set aside for fill in during pivoting.
!
!    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
!    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
!    Each block is stored by columns.
!
!    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
!    the first (ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using the obvious variant
!    of the LINPACK general band format.
!
!    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
!    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:
!
!    Entries of A1:
!
!      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (I-J+MU+1)+(J-1)*(ML+MU+1).
!
!    Entries of A2:
!
!      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.
!
!    Entries of A3:
!
!      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
!
!    Entries of A4:
!
!      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
!      (same formula used for A3).

!! R8CBB_FA factors an R8CBB matrix.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The R8CBB storage format is for a compressed border banded matrix.  
!    Such a matrix has the logical form:
!
!      A1 | A2
!      ---+---
!      A3 | A4
!
!    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
!    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
!    respectively.  
!
!    The R8CBB format is the same as the R8BB format, except that the banded
!    matrix A1 is stored in compressed band form rather than standard
!    banded form.  In other words, we do not include the extra room
!    set aside for fill in during pivoting.
!
!    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
!    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
!    Each block is stored by columns.
!
!    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
!    the first (ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using the obvious variant
!    of the LINPACK general band format.
!
!    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
!    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:
!
!    Entries of A1:
!
!      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (I-J+MU+1)+(J-1)*(ML+MU+1).
!
!    Entries of A2:
!
!      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.
!
!    Entries of A3:
!
!      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
!
!    Entries of A4:
!
!      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2
!
!      Store the I, J entry into location
!      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
!      (same formula used for A3).
!
!    Once the matrix has been factored by R8CBB_FA, R8CBB_SL may be called
!    to solve linear systems involving the matrix.
!
!    R8CBB_FA uses special non-pivoting versions of LINPACK routines to
!    carry out the factorization.  The special version of the banded
!    LINPACK solver also results in a space saving, since no entries
!    need be set aside for fill in due to pivoting.
!
!    The linear system must be border banded, of the form:
!
!      ( A1 A2 ) (X1) = (B1)
!      ( A3 A4 ) (X2)   (B2)
!
!    where A1 is a (usually big) banded square matrix, A2 and A3 are
!    column and row strips which may be nonzero, and A4 is a dense
!    square matrix.
!
!    The algorithm rewrites the system as:
!
!         X1 + inverse(A1) A2 X2 = inverse(A1) B1
!
!      A3 X1 +             A4 X2 = B2
!
!    and then rewrites the second equation as
!
!      ( A4 - A3 inverse(A1) A2 ) X2 = B2 - A3 inverse(A1) B1
!
!    The algorithm will certainly fail if the matrix A1 is singular,
!    or requires pivoting.  The algorithm will also fail if the A4 matrix,
!    as modified during the process, is singular, or requires pivoting.
!    All these possibilities are in addition to the failure that will
!    if the total matrix A is singular.

!    Such a matrix has the logical form:
!
!      A1 | A2

!
!    The R8CBB format is the same as the R8BB format, except that the banded

!! R8GB_FA performs a LINPACK-style PLU factorization of an R8GB matrix.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The R8GB storage format is for an M by N banded matrix, with lower 
!    bandwidth ML and upper bandwidth MU.  Storage includes room for ML 
!    extra superdiagonals, which may be required to store nonzero entries 
!    generated during Gaussian elimination.
!
!    The original M by N matrix is "collapsed" downward, so that diagonals
!    become rows of the storage array, while columns are preserved.  The
!    collapsed array is logically 2*ML+MU+1 by N.  
!
!    This routine is based on the LINPACK routine SGBFA.
!
!    R8GB storage is used by LINPACK and LAPACK.
!
!    The following program segment will set up the input.
!
!      m = ml + mu + 1
!      do j = 1, n
!        i1 = max ( 1, j - mu )
!        i2 = min ( n, j + ml )
!        do i = i1, i2
!          k = i - j + m
!          a(k,j) = afull(i,j)
!        end do
!      end do
!
!    This uses rows ML+1 through 2*ML+MU+1 of the array A.
!    In addition, the first ML rows in the array are used for
!    elements generated during the triangularization.
!
!    The ML+MU by ML+MU upper left triangle and the
!    ML by ML lower right triangle are not referenced.

!! R8GB_SL solves a system factored by R8GB_FA.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The R8GB storage format is for an M by N banded matrix, with lower 
!    bandwidth ML and upper bandwidth MU.  Storage includes room for ML 
!    extra superdiagonals, which may be required to store nonzero entries 
!    generated during Gaussian elimination.
!
!    The original M by N matrix is "collapsed" downward, so that diagonals
!    become rows of the storage array, while columns are preserved.  The
!    collapsed array is logically 2*ML+MU+1 by N.  
!
!    R8GB storage is used by LINPACK and LAPACK.
