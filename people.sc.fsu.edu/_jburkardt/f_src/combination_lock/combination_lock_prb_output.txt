COMBINATION_LOCK
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the COMBINATION_LOCK libary.
 
TEST01
  A bicycle combination lock consists of 3 dials,
  each having 10 symbols, 0 through 9.
  We seek to determine the combination C.
 
  The number of dials is M =    3
  The number of symbols is N =   10
  The number of possible combinations is M^N =     1000
  The "secret" combination is 360
 
  The combination was found on step      361
 
TEST02
  A combination lock consists of M dials,
  each having N symbols.
  We seek to determine the combination C.
 
  The number of dials is M =    4
  The number of symbols is N =    5
  The number of possible combinations is M^N =      625
 
  The "secret" combination:
 
         1:             1
         2:             2
         3:             3
         4:             4
 
  The combination was found on step      195
 
COMBINATION_LOCK
  Normal end of execution.
