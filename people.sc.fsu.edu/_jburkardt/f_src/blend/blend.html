      BLEND <br> Transfinite Interpolation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BLEND</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      "blends" multidimensional data, that is, performs a kind
      of interpolation.  However, in this case, the data may be known at
      points, or curves, or planes, and is to be extended to a higher-dimensional
      domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a common way of creating a smooth set of data based on
      a small set of known values.  For instance, if we measure the
      temperature every hour, we naturally assume that the temperature
      at 2:15 can be approximated by "blending" 1/4 of the temperature
      at 3:00 and 3/4 of the temperature at 2:00.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now suppose that we take the temperature at evenly spaced points
      on the floor of a room.  We can again see how to use blending so
      that, in each little square, we take a blend of the values at the
      four corners to get the value at any point within the square.
      Similar ideas can be used with a cube.
    </p>

    <p>
      More complicated cases might arise where we know the temperature
      everywhere along lines, or along planes that cut through a cube.
      Even then, it is possible to blend the data in a smooth and
      sensible way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>BLEND</b> interpolates values based on a set of given data.
      <b>BLEND</b> can handle input data that is 1, 2, or 3 dimensional.
      In the general, 3D case, the data can depend on smoothly varying
      space parameters (R,S,T) or on tabular indices (I,J,K).  The data
      may be given at the corners, edges, or faces of the unit cube.
      In the (R,S,T) case, <b>BLEND</b> can supply an interpolated value at
      any point in the cube.  In the (I,J,K) case, <b>BLEND</b> will fill in
      tabular values for all intermediate indices.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the simplest case, where BLEND is only given data values at the
      endpoints of a line segment, the 4 corners of a square, or the 8
      corners of a cube, BLEND is equivalent to linear, bilinear
      or trilinear finite element interpolation of the data.  However,
      in the more interesting cases where BLEND is given, say, a formula
      for the data along the sides of the square, or the edges of the
      cube, the interpolation is called "transfinite", since in theory
      it samples the input data at more than a finite number of points.
