    <p>
      <b>APPORTIONMENT</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which 
      demonstrates some of the methods used to apportion seats
      in the United States House of Representatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Methods that have been proposed include:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Alexander Hamilton's method;
        </li>
        <li>
          Thomas Jefferson's method;
        </li>
        <li>
          John Adam's method;
        </li>
        <li>
          Daniel Webster's method;
        </li>
        <li>
          The Huntington-Hill method (the method used since 1940);
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      Article I, Section 2 of the US Constitution:
    </h2>

    <p>
      <i>
        The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen 
        every second Year by the People of the several States, and the 
        Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite
        for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained
        to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen
        of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an 
        Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
        several States which may be included within this Union, according
        to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding
        to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to
        Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed,
        three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall 
        be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress
        of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years,
        in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of 
        Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand,
        but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until
        such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall
        be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and
        Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New
        Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, 
        Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and 
        Georgia three.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the 
        Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill
        such Vacancies.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other 
        Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.
