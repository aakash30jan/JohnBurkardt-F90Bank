    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>UMFPACK</b>,
      FORTRAN90 programs which
      illustrate how to solve sparse linear systems by calling
      the C library UMFPACK, by Timothy Davis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The UMFPACK library, written by Timothy Davis,
      is part of the SuiteSparse package, which is
      available from <a href = "http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/">
                                http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/ </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Calling UMFPACK requires linking additional libraries from the
      SuiteSparse collection.  The executable shell scripts given here suggest
      how this might be done.
    </p>

    <p>
      UMFPACK requires that the sparse matrix be stored in a common format
      known as "compressed column storage".  UMFPACK uses the C indexing 
      convention, in which the first element of a vector has index 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, the matrix whose full representation is:
      <pre>
       11 12  0  0  0
       21  0 23  0 25
        0 32 33 34  0
        0  0 43  0  0
        0 52 53  0 55
      </pre>
      would be stored in compressed column storage as:
      <pre>
         #  R   CC   X
        --  -   --  --
         0  0    0  11
         1  1       21

         2  0    2  12
         3  2       32
         4  4       52

         5  1    5  23
         6  2       33
         7  3       43
         8  4       53

         9  2    9  34

        10  1   10  25
        11  4       55

        12  -   12
      </pre>
      and this is the matrix used in the simple example code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Calling a C library from FORTRAN90 is often difficult, and the details can
      vary depending on the computer operating system and compilers used.  
      Moreover, calling UMFPACK
      requires linking additional libraries from the SuiteSparse collection.
      The executable shell scripts given here suggest how this
      might be done.

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The SIMPLE example demonstrates the use of UMFPACK on a 5x5 "sparse" matrix.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "umfpack_simple.f90">umfpack_simple.f90</a>, the source code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "umfpack_simple_output.txt">umfpack_simple_output.txt</a>,
          the output file.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The WATHEN example demonstrates the use of UMFPACK on a sparse matrix
      that is an instance of the Wathen finite element mass matrix.  The matrix
      is created using the sparse triplet (ST) format, and must be converted to
      the compressed column (CC) format before calling UMFPACK.  This demonstrates
      why the 5x5 SIMPLE example is not representative of the typical use of UMFPACK.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "umfpack_wathen.f90">umfpack_wathen.f90</a>, the source code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "umfpack_wathen_output.txt">umfpack_wathen_output.txt</a>,
          the output file.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The WEST example demonstrates the use of UMFPACK on a sparse matrix
      in the compressed column (CC) format, stored in three files.  The matrix
      is read from the files, and then UMFPACK is called to handle an associated
      linear system.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "umfpack_west.f90">umfpack_west.f90</a>, the source code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "umfpack_west_output.txt">umfpack_west_output.txt</a>,
          the output file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "west_acc.txt">west_acc.txt</a>,
          a file containing the nonzero matrix values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "west_ccc.txt">west_ccc.txt</a>,
          a file containing the compressed column indices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "west_icc.txt">west_icc.txt</a>,
          a file containing the row indices of the nonzero matrix values.
        </li>
      </ul>
