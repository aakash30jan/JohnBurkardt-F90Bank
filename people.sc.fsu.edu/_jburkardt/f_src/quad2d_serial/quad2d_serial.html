    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUAD2D_SERIAL</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      estimates an integral over a 2D rectangle by using 
      a product quadrature rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is intended as a starting point;
      both MPI and OpenMP can be used to make a parallel version.
