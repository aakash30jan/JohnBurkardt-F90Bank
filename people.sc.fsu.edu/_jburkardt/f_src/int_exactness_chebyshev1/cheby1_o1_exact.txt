INT_EXACTNESS_CHEBYSHEV1
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Chebyshev
  type 1 quadrature rule by integrating weighted 
  monomials up to a given degree over the [-1,+1] interval.
 
INT_EXACTNESS_CHEBYSHEV1: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "cheby1_o1_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "cheby1_o1_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "cheby1_o1_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check =        5
 
  Spatial dimension =        1
  Number of points  =        1
 
  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Chebyshev type 1 rule
  ORDER =        1
 
  Standard rule:
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) f(x) / sqrt ( 1 - x^2 ) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).
 
  Weights W:
 
  w( 1) =    3.141592653589793    
 
  Abscissas X:
 
  x( 1) =   0.6123233995736765E-16
 
  Region R:
 
  r( 1) =  -1.0000000000000000    
  r( 2) =   1.0000000000000000    
 
  A Gauss-Chebyshev type 1 rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree =        1
