INT_EXACTNESS_GEGENBAUER
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Gegenbauer
  quadrature rule by integrating weighted 
  monomials up to a given degree over the [-1,+1] interval.
 
INT_EXACTNESS_GEGENBAUER: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "gegen_o1_a0.5_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "gegen_o1_a0.5_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "gegen_o1_a0.5_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check =        5
  Exponent of (1-x^2), ALPHA =   0.500000    
 
  Spatial dimension =        1
  Number of points  =        1
 
  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Gegenbauer rule
  ORDER =        1
  ALPHA =   0.500000    
 
  Standard rule:
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) (1-x^2)^alpha f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).
 
  Weights W:
 
  w( 1) =    1.570796326794897    
 
  Abscissas X:
 
  x( 1) =    0.000000000000000    
 
  Region R:
 
  r( 1) =  -1.0000000000000000    
  r( 2) =   1.0000000000000000    
 
  A Gauss-Gegenbauer rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree =        1
