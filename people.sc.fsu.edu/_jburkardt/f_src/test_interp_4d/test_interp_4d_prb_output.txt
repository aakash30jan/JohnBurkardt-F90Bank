TEST_INTERP_4D_PRB
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the TEST_INTERP_4D library.
 
TEST01
  Demonstrate some of the bookkeeping routines.
  P00_PROB_NUM returns the number of problems.
  P00_TITLE returns the problem title.
  P00_LIMIT returns the problem limits.
 
  Number of problems =        2
 
  Problem        1
  Problem TITLE = "4D Runge example, f(x,y) = 1 / ( w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2 + 1 )".
  Problem lower limit A =    5.00000    
  Problem upper limit B =    5.00000    
 
  Problem        2
  Problem TITLE = "Press offcenter Gaussian".
  Problem lower limit A =    1.00000    
  Problem upper limit B =    1.00000    
 
TEST02
  P00_STORY prints the problem "story".
 
  Problem        1
 
  This is a 4D version of Runge's function.
  In 1D, equally spaced interpolation nodes
  result in a sequence of interpolants that
  become highly oscillatory.
 
  Problem        2
 
  This is an example from William Press.
  It is an offcenter Gaussian tapered in the
  unit hypercube, zero at the edges.
 
TEST03
  Nearest neighbor interpolation.
  Evaluate the function on an NxN equally spaced grid.
  The interpolated value at any point is the value
  at the nearest interpolating node.
  Estimate the integral of the square of the error
  between the function and the interpolant.
