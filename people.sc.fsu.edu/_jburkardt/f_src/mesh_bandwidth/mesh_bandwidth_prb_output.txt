MESH_BANDWIDTH
  FORTRAN90 version
  Read a mesh file which defines
  a "triangulation" of a region in the plane,
  or a "tetrahedronization" of a region in space,
  or any division of a regino in ND space into elements,
  using a mesh of elements of uniform order.
 
  Determine the geometric mesh bandwidth.
 
    M = ML + 1 + MU.
 
  which is the bandwidth of the vertex connectivity
  matrix.
 
  Note that a matrix associated with variables defined
  at the  nodes could have a greater bandwidth than M,
  since you might have multiple variables at a vertex,
  or the variable might be a vector quantity,
  or physical effects might link two variables that are
  not associated with vertices that are connected.
