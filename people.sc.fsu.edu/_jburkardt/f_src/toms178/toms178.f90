!! HOOKE seeks a minimizer of a scalar function of several variables.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This routine find a point X where the nonlinear objective function
!    F(X) has a local minimum.  X is an N-vector and F(X) is a scalar.
!    The objective function F(X) is not required to be differentiable
!    or even continuous.  The program does not use or require derivatives
!    of the objective function.
!
!    The user supplies three things:
!    1) a subroutine that computes F(X),
!    2) an initial "starting guess" of the minimum point X,
!    3) values for the algorithm convergence parameters.
!
!    The program searches for a local minimum, beginning from the
!    starting guess, using the Direct Search algorithm of Hooke and
!    Jeeves.
!
!    This program is adapted from the Algol pseudocode found in the
!    paper by Kaupe, and includes improvements suggested by Bell and Pike,
!    and by Tomlin and Smith.
!
!    The algorithm works by taking "steps" from one estimate of
!    a minimum, to another (hopefully better) estimate.  Taking
!    big steps gets to the minimum more quickly, at the risk of
!    "stepping right over" an excellent point.  The stepsize is
!    controlled by a user supplied parameter called RHO.  At each
!    iteration, the stepsize is multiplied by RHO  (0 < RHO < 1),
!    so the stepsize is successively reduced.
!
!    Small values of rho correspond to big stepsize changes,
!    which make the algorithm run more quickly.  However, there
!    is a chance (especially with highly nonlinear functions)
!    that these big changes will accidentally overlook a
!    promising search vector, leading to nonconvergence.
!
!    Large values of RHO correspond to small stepsize changes,
!    which force the algorithm to carefully examine nearby points
!    instead of optimistically forging ahead.  This improves the
!    probability of convergence.
!
!    The stepsize is reduced until it is equal to (or smaller
!    than) EPS.  So the number of iterations performed by
!    Hooke-Jeeves is determined by RHO and EPS:
!
!      RHO^(number_of_iterations) = EPS
!
!    In general it is a good idea to set RHO to an aggressively
!    small value like 0.5 (hoping for fast convergence).  Then,
!    if the user suspects that the reported minimum is incorrect
!    (or perhaps not accurate enough), the program can be run
!    again with a larger value of RHO such as 0.85, using the
!    result of the first minimization as the starting guess to
!    begin the second minimization.
!
!    Normal use:
!    (1) Code your function F() in the C language;
!    (2) Install your starting guess;
!    (3) Run the program.
!
!    If there are doubts about the result, the computed minimizer
!    can be used as the starting point for a second minimization attempt.
!
!    To apply this method to data fitting, code your function F() to be
!    the sum of the squares of the errors (differences) between the
!    computed values and the measured values.  Then minimize F()
!    using Hooke-Jeeves.
!
!    For example, you have 20 datapoints (T(i), Y(i)) and you want to
!    find A, B and C so that:
!
!      A*t*t + B*exp(t) + C*tan(t)
!
!    fits the data as closely as possible.  Then the objective function
!    F() to be minimized is just
!
!      F(A,B,C) = sum ( 1 <= i <= 20 )
!        ( y(i) - A*t(i)*t(i) - B*exp(t(i)) - C*tan(t(i)) )^2.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NVARS, the number of spatial dimensions.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) STARTPT(NVARS), the user-supplied
!    initial estimate for the minimizer.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) ENDPT(NVARS), the estimate for the
!    minimizer, as calculated by the program.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) RHO, a user-supplied convergence parameter
!    which should be set to a value between 0.0 and 1.0.  Larger values
!    of RHO give greater probability of convergence on highly nonlinear
!    functions, at a cost of more function evaluations.  Smaller
!    values of RHO reduce the number of evaluations and the program
!    running time, but increases the risk of nonconvergence.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) EPS, the criterion for halting
!    the search for a minimum.  When the algorithm
!    begins to make less and less progress on each
!    iteration, it checks the halting criterion: if
!    the stepsize is below EPS, terminate the
!    iteration and return the current best estimate
!    of the minimum.  Larger values of EPS (such
!    as 1.0e-4) give quicker running time, but a
!    less accurate estimate of the minimum.  Smaller
!    values of EPS (such as 1.0e-7) give longer
!    running time, but a more accurate estimate of
!    the minimum.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) ITERMAX, a limit on the number of iterations.
!
!    Input, external real ( kind = 8 ) F, the name of the function routine,
!    which should have the form:
!      function f ( x, n )
!      integer ( kind = 4 ) n
!      real ( kind = 8 ) f
!      real ( kind = 8 ) x(n)
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) HOOKE, the number of iterations taken.
