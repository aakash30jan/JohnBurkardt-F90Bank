  A test for DQED
 
  This example uses reverse communication.
 
  The stable isotope problem for the alligator.
  We assume an alligator has 6 kinds of prey, and 
  that the concentrations of isotopic C13 and N15 
  are known in the prey and in the alligator.
 
  We want to determine dietary proportions X1 through X6
  so that the isotope values in the alligator can 
  be explained
  in terms of how much of what prey it eats.
 
  Our model:
 
    (C_All) = (C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 ) * (X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6)'
    (N_All) = (N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 )
 
  Our computed answer X:
 
   0.00000    
  0.335465    
  0.186226    
   0.00000    
  0.351095    
  0.127213    
 
  The residual of the fitted data, FNORM =   0.366205E-14
 
  Sum of variables =    1.00000    
 
  Number of model evaluations NITERS =      3
