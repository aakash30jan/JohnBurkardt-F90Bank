      HALTON_ADVANCED <br> The Halton Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) Sequence
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HALTON_ADVANCED</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      computes elements of a Halton Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      HALTON_ADVANCED includes routines to make it easy to manipulate this
      computation, to compute the next N entries, to compute a particular
      entry, to restart the sequence at a particular point, or to compute
      NDIM-dimensional versions of the sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the most straightforward use, try either
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>I4_TO_HALTON</b>, for one element of a sequence;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I4_TO_HALTON_SEQUENCE</b>, for N elements of a sequence;
        </li>
      </ul>
      Both of these routines require explicit input values for all
      parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more convenience, there are two related routines with
      almost no input arguments:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>HALTON</b>, for one element of a sequence;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HALTON_SEQUENCE</b>, for N elements of a sequence;
        </li>
      </ul>
      These routines allow the user to either rely on the default
      values of parameters, or to change a few of them by calling
      appropriate routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The NDIM-dimensional Halton sequence is really NDIM separate
      sequences, each generated by a particular base.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines in this library select elements of a "leaped" subsequence of
      the Halton sequence.  The subsequence elements are indexed by a
      quantity called STEP, which starts at 0.  The STEP-th subsequence
      element is simply the Halton sequence element with index
      <pre>
        SEED(1:NDIM) + STEP * LEAP(1:NDIM).
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The arguments that the user may set include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          NDIM, the spatial dimension, <br>
          default: NDIM = 1, <br>
          required: 1 &lt;= NDIM;
        </li>
        <li>
          STEP, the subsequence index.<br>
          default: STEP = 0,<br>
          required: 0 &lt;= STEP.
        </li>
        <li>
          SEED(1:NDIM), the Halton sequence index corresponding
          to STEP = 0.<br>
          default: SEED(1:NDIM) = (0, 0, ... 0),<br>
          required: 0 &lt;= SEED(1:NDIM);
        </li>
        <li>
          LEAP(1:NDIM), the succesive jumps in the Halton sequence.<br>
          default: LEAP(1:NDIM) = (1, 1, ..., 1).<br>
          required: 1 &lt;= LEAP(1:NDIM).
        </li>
        <li>
          BASE(1:NDIM), the Halton bases.<br>
          default: BASE(1:NDIM) = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11... ),<br>
          required: 1 &lt; BASE(1:NDIM).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The NDIM-dimensional Halton sequence is derived from the 1-dimensional
      van der Corput sequence.  Each dimension typically uses a different
      prime number as the base of the calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The NDIM-dimensional Halton sequence is related to the NDIM+1 dimensional
      Hammersley sequence
      of length NMAX.  An NDIM+1 dimensional Hammersley
      sequence of length NMAX becomes an NDIM-dimensional Halton sequence by
      deleting the first dimension.  An NDIM dimensional Halton sequence of NMAX
      points becomes an NDIM+1 dimensional Hammersley sequence of length NMAX
      by prefixing a first coordinate, and setting the value of this
      first coordinate to I/NMAX for the I-th entry of the sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the Hammersley sequence has better dispersion properties
      in technical measures such as the discrepancy, it suffers from the
      problem that you must know, beforehand, the number of points you
      are going to generate.  Thus, if you have computed a Hammersley
      sequence of length 100, and you want to compute a Hammersley sequence
      of length 200, you must discard your current values and start over.
      By contrast, you can compute 100 points of a Halton sequence, and
      then 100 more, and this will be the same as computing the first 200
      points of the Halton sequence in one calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In low dimensions, the multidimensional Halton sequence quickly
      "fills up" the space in a well-distributed pattern.  However,
      for higher dimensions (such as NDIM = 40) for instance, the initial
      elements of the Halton sequence can be very poorly distributed;
      it is only when N, the number of sequence elements, is large
      enough relative to the spatial dimension, that the sequence is
      properly behaved.  Remedies for this problem were suggested
      by Kocis and Whiten.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example of the use of Halton sequences, we also use them
      to compute "random" points on or in the unit circle in 2D,
      and the unit sphere in 3D.
