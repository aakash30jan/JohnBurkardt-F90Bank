    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SEARCH_SERIAL</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      searches integers between A and B for a value J such that F(J) = C.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the particular example considered here, the solution will be
      F(1,674,924,981) = 45.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is intended as a starting point;
      both MPI and OpenMP can be used to make a parallel version.
