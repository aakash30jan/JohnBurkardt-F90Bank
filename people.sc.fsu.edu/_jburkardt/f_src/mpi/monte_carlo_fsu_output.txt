 
MONTE_CARLO_MPI:
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  An MPI example program to
  estimate PI by the Monte Carlo method.
 
  The number of processes is        8
 
  Points in the unit square will be tested
  to see if they lie in the unit quarter circle.
 
  Process   0 is active.
 
  The method continues computing until:
  PI is computed to a tolerance of   0.100000E-02
  or the number of points used reaches   1000000
