 
INTERVALS - Master process:
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  An MPI example program.
  A quadrature over an interval is done by
  assigning subintervals to processes.
  The number of processes is        8
 
Process        0: Active!
 
Process        1: Active!
 
Process        2: Active!
 
Process        4: Active!
 
Process        5: Active!
 
Process        6: Active!
 
Process        7: Active!
 
Process        3: Active!
 
INTERVALS - Master process:
  Subintervals have been assigned.
