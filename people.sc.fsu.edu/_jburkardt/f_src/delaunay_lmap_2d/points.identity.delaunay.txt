#  The data was created by the FORTRAN90 DELAUNAY_2D program.
#  The node data was read from points.txt by RTABLE_DATA_READ.F90.
#  The spatial dimension of the node data was      2
#  The number of nodes was     10
#
#  The Delaunay triangulation was computed by RTRIS2_LMAP.
#  The data was written to points.delaunay.txt by ITABLE_TRIANGULATION_WRITE.F90.
