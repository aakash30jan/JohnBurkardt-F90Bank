      OPTIMIZE <br> Taking Advantage of the Compiler's Optimization Ability
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>OPTIMIZE</b>
      is a directory of FORTRAN90 programs which
      demonstrate the use and benefits of the compiler's automatic optimization
      ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most compilers have an option to "optimize" your code; that is, to spend
      some extra compilation time looking for ways to adjust your program so that
      it runs faster, while getting the same results.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, compiler optimization is not accessed.  In GFORTRAN, you
      can request optimization by including the "-O#' option where '#' is
      a value between 0 (no optimization) and 3 (high optimization).  Asking
      for a higher level of optimization may increase the compilation time
      somewhat, and occasionally, an optimization performed by the compiler
      might not be suitable for your program (in other words, it might make
      your program return different or incorrect results.)  Thus, it's important
      to time your code before and after optimization, to see if it helps,
      and to check your results, to see if it hurts!
    </p>

    <p>
      The molecular dynamics example program given here runs in about 40 seconds.  
      After optimization at level 1, it runs in 30 seconds.  Optimization level 2 brings the
      run time down to 13 seconds and level 3 to 10 seconds.  These improvements come with 
      not a single change to the source code.
