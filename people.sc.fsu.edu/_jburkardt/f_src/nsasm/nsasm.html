    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NSASM</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      carries out the
      finite element assembly of the jacobian matrix used in a Newton
      iteration to solve the steady state incompressible Navier Stokes
      equations in a 2D region, by Per-Olof Persson.
    </p>

    <p>
      The finite element approximation uses the P2-P1 triangular
      element, also known as the Taylor-Hood element.  The velocities
      are approximated quadratically, and the pressures linearly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sparse matrix format used is known as the <i>compressed
      column format</i>, in which the nonzero entries and their row indices
      are stored in order by columns.
    </p>

    <p>
      The software assumes that a suitable mesh has been set up for the
      region, with arrays P and T defining that mesh, that an array
      defining the boundary constraints has been set up, and that an
      initial estimate of the flow has been made available.
    </p>

    <p>
      The software was originally designed to be called,
      via MATLAB's <b>mex</b> facility,
      with the linear system solved by <b>SUPER_LU</b>.
      Thus, the Newton iteration could have the following form:
      <pre>
        for ii = 1 : 8
          [ K, L ] = nsasm ( p, t, np0, e, u, mu );
          du = - lusolve ( K, L );
          u = u + du;
          disp ( sprintf ( '%20.10g  %20.10g', norm ( L, inf ), norm ( du, inf ) ) );
        end
      </pre>
    </p>

      Indexing Conventions
    </h3>

    <p>
      The software makes some particular assumptions about the
      numbering of nodes, variables, and local element nodes
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>(Indexing of nodes)</i> It is assumed that the mesh was
      generated by starting with a set of nodes, triangulating them,
      and then computing the midsides of the triangles and adding
      these midsides to the list of nodes.  In particular, the program
      therefore assumes that the numbering of the nodes reflects this
      process, so that all vertex nodes are numbered first, followed
      by the midside nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>(Indexing of global variables)</i> It is assumed that
      every node has an associated horizontal velocity variable "U",
      that every node has an associated vertical velocity variable "V",
      and that only vertex nodes or "pressure nodes" have an
      associated pressure variable "P".  The variables are stored in a
      single vector, first all the U's, then all the V's, then the
      P's.  Thus variable 1 is the value of U at node 1, variable
      NP+1 is the value of V at node 1, and variable 2*NP+1 is
      the value of P at node 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that there are even more global variables than you
      might think, since the boundary conditions and other constraints
      are handled by adding a Lagrange multiplier for each one.
      Thus the number of variables is actually 2*NP+NP0+NE.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>(Numerical codes for U,V,P)</i>  In the E vector used to define
      constraints, the numeric codes 0, 1 and 2 are used for U, V and
      P variables respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>(Local numbering of nodes)</i>  When listing the 6 nodes
      that make up a triangle, the ordering should be as follows:
      <pre>
        N3
         |\
         | \
         |  \
        N5   N4
         |    \
         |     \
         |      \
        N1--N6--N2
      </pre>
