POD_BASIS_FLOW
  Given a PDE for which:
    M is the dimension of each solution vector,
    N is the number of solution vectors,
 
  Set up A, the M by N matrix of solution vectors,
 
  Get A = U * S * V', the singular value decomposition.
 
 
  The variable RUN_TYPE determines preprocessing:
* 1, NO steady state file, no preprocessing;
* 2, NO steady state file, no preprocessing;
* 3,    steady state file;
    subtract 1/3 SS from solution  1
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 2 through 201
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
* 4,    steady state file;
    subtract 1/3 SS from solution  1
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 2 through 201
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
    discard the EVEN numbered data files.
* 5,    steady state file;
    subtract 1/3 SS from solution  1
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 2 through 201
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
    normalize the data.
* 6,    steady state file;
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
    do NOT normalize the result.
* 7,    steady state file;
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
    NORMALIZE the result.
    discard the ODD numbered data files.
* 8,    steady state file;
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
    do NOT normalize the result.
 
What is the run type (1-8)?
 
  RUN_TYPE =        1
 
What is the requested basis size?
 
  BASIS_NUM =       16
 
  What is the XY data file name?
 
  The file "/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/tcell_flow/xy.txt" contains 4961 lines.
 
  X minimum :    0.00000    
  X maximum :    1.00000    
  Y minimum :    0.00000    
  Y maximum :    1.00000    
 
What is the name of the steady state file or "none"?
 
  Steady state information was read from
  the file "/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets//tcell_flow/steady.txt".
 
  Steady max norm =    3.00284    
  Steady l2 norm =     121.425    
 
  It is time to read sets of solution files.
 
  We assume that a series of solution files exists,
  with "consecutive" names, like
    fred001.txt, fred002,txt, ...
  Just specify the FIRST name in the series, and
  the program will read them all.
 
  The program can read another series of data if
  you specify yet another first name, or you can
  type "none" when there are no more file series.
 
 
What is the first solution file (in the first series)?
 
What is the first solution file (in the NEXT series) or "none"?
 
  The user indicated the end of the series.
 
  The number of initial solution files is        1
  The total number of solution files is      500
 
  The data is stored in an M by N matrix.
 
  The "spatial" dimension M is       9922
  The number of data points N is      500
 
 
  Processing files starting with "/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/tcell_flow/up001.txt".
  Reading file        1  /a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/tcell_flow/up001.txt
  Reading file      500  /a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/tcell_flow/up500.txt
 
  All the data has been read into POINT.
 
  Enter element file for mass matrix preconditioning or "None".
 
  The user indicated there is no element file.
 
SINGULAR_VECTORS:
  For an MxN matrix A in general storage,
  we call the LAPACK routine
    DGESVD
  which computes the singular value decomposition:
    A = U * S * V'
