#  Our run type is 2.  For now, this simply specifies the
#  preprocessing of the solution vectors, and the
#  deletion of the odd numbered data vectors.

/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/cavity_flow/xy.txt
#
#  The steady state file:
#
/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/cavity_flow/steady.txt
#
#  The first file of the first solution set.
#
/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/cavity_flow/up001.txt
#
#  The first file of the second solution set.

None
#
#  Specify element file, so compute and use the mass matrix.
