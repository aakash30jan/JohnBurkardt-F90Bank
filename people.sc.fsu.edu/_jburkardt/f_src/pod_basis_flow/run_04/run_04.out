POD_BASIS
  Given a PDE for which:
    M is the dimension of each solution vector,
    N is the number of solution vectors,
 
  Set up A, the M by N matrix of solution vectors,
 
  Get A = U * S * VT, the singular value decomposition.
 
 
What is the run type?
 
  RUN_TYPE =      1
 
What is the requested basis size?
 
  BASIS_NUM =     16
 
  For RUN_TYPE = 1,
  read in the steady state solution
  and, letting SS be the steady state solution,
  subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
  subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
 
What is the XY data file name?
 
  The file "/home/r1/src-samples/datasets/cavity_flow/xy.txt" contains 1681 lines.
 
  X minimum :    0.00000    
  X maximum :    1.00000    
  Y minimum :    0.00000    
  Y maximum :    1.00000    
 
What is the steady state file name?
 
  Steady state information was read from
  the file "/home/r1/src-samples/datasets/cavity_flow/steady.txt".
 
  Steady max norm =    3.00000    
  Steady l2 norm =     33.7950    
 
What is the first solution file name?
 
We believe the number of solution files is    500
 
  The data is stored in an M by N matrix.
 
  The "spatial" dimension M is     3362
  The number of data points N is    500
 
All the data has been read into POINT.
 
Enter element file for mass matrix preconditioning or "None".
 
  Number of elements =    800
  Number of nodes per element =      6
 
  The bandwidth of the matrix is     85
 
  Compute the mass matrix.
 
  Cholesky-factor the mass matrix.
 
SINGULAR_VECTORS
  For an MxN matrix A in general storage,
  SGESVD computes the singular value decomposition:
    A = U * S * V'
 
 
  Singular values:
 
   1    3.5881
   2    1.6983
   3    1.0092
   4    0.3600
   5    0.1568
   6    0.0890
   7    0.0660
   8    0.0585
   9    0.0421
  10    0.0271
  11    0.0218
  12    0.0107
  13    0.0087
  14    0.0049
  15    0.0034
