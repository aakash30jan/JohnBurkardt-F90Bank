    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>POD_BASIS_FLOW</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      applies the principal
      orthogonal direction (POD) analysis to a set of solutions of a
      PDE that models two dimensional time dependent fluid flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      This procedure, originally devised by Karl Pearson, has arisen
      repeatedly in a variety of fields, and hence is known under
      various names, including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the Hotelling transform;
        </li>
        <li>
          the discrete Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT)
        </li>
        <li>
          Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        </li>
        <li>
          Principal Orthogonal Direction (POD)
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
        </li>
        <li>
          Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        You almost certainly should rather use the simpler program
        called
        <a href = "../svd_basis/svd_basis.html">SVD_BASIS</a>,
        which does not assume that the data comes from a particular
        fluid flow problem!
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of the algorithm is to extract the dominant modes
      of behavior of the system; these modes could then be used, for
      instance, in a reduced order model of the physical system.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the computations considered here, a partial differential
      equation (PDE) has been defined, specifying the time-dependent
      flow of a fluid through a region.  The PDE specification includes
      a parameter <b>alpha</b> whose value strongly affects the behavior of
      the flow.  The steady state solution X0 is computed for a particular
      value of <b>alpha</b>.  Then the time-dependent problem is solved over a
      fixed time interval, with <b>alpha</b> varying from time to time.
      A set of several hundred solutions X(T(I),<b>alpha</b>(I)) are saved.
    </p>

    <p>
      The need is to try to extract from this solution data the
      typical modes of behavior of the solution, that is, a small set
      of orthogonal vectors <b>V</b> such that "most" of the solution
      vectors <b>X</b> can be well represented by a linear combination
      of elements of <b>V</b>.  Such a set of modes may then be used as
      a finite element basis that is highly tuned to the physics of the
      problem, so that a very small set of basis functions can be used
      to closely approximate the behavior of the solution over a range
      of values of <b>alpha</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method of extracting information from the solution data
      begins by constructing an <b>M</b> by <b>N</b> matrix <b>A</b>, each
      of whose columns is one of the solution vectors <b>X</b>.  Thus,
      <blockquote><b>
        A = [ X1 | X2 | ... | XN ]
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the singular value decomposition of <b>A</b>:
      <blockquote><b>
        A = U * S * V'
      </b></blockquote>
      is determined using the DGESVD routine from the linear algebra package
      LAPACK.
      A subset of the columns of the orthogonal <b>M</b> by <b>M</b>
      matrix <b>U</b>, associated with the largest singular values <b>S</b>,
      is chosen to form the POD basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the data comes from a finite element computation, and
      the results may be used as a new reduced basis, it may be
      desirable to carry out mass matrix preconditioning of the data,
      so that output POD vectors are orthogonal
      in the L2 inner product (integration of the product of the finite
      element functions over the domain).
    </p>

    <p>
      The current version of the program assumes that a steady state
      solution <b>SS</b> of the PDE is known, and that a multiple
      of SS is to be subtracted from each solution vector before processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>FILES</b>: the program assumes the existence of the following files:
      (the actual names of the files are specified by the user at run time.
      The names used here are just suggestions.)
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>xy.txt</i>, contains the (x,y) coordinates of each node, with
          one pair of coordinates per line of the file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>ss.txt</i>, contains the (u,v) values at each node for the
          steady state solution, with one pair of values per line of the file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>uv01.txt</i>, <i>uv02.txt</i>, ..., contains the (u,v) values
          at each node for solution 1, 2, and so on;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>element.txt</i>, contains the indices of the six nodes that
          make up each element, with one set of six indices per line of
          the file <i>(only needed if mass matrix
          preconditioning is used)</i>;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>INPUT</b>: at run time, the user specifies:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>run_type</i> describes how we subtract off the steady state,
          whether we drop some data, and other options.  The current
          values range from 1 to 8.  The most common value is 6, used
          with the TCELL data:
          <ol>
            <li>
              no steady state file, no preprocessing;
            </li>
            <li>
              no steady state file, no preprocessing;
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 1/3 SS from solution 1, 5/3 SS from solutions
              2 to 201, and 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 1/3 SS from solution 1, 5/3 SS from solutions
              2 to 201, and 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401,
              and drop the even-numbered data.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 1/3 SS from solution 1, 5/3 SS from solutions
              2 to 201, and 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401,
              and skip half the data and normalize it.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 5/3 SS from solutions
              1 to 250, and 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500, do not
              normalize.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 5/3 SS from solutions
              1 to 250, and 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500,
              normalize the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 5/3 SS from solutions
              1 to 250, and 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500, then
              drop the odd-numbered data, do not
              normalize.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>basis_num</i>, the requested basis size.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>xy_file</i>, the name of the xy file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>steady_file</i>, the name of the steady state solution file
          (only if <b>run_type</b> is 1 or 2).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>uv0_file</i>, the name of the first solution file (the program
          will assume all the files are numbered consecutively).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>element_file</i>, the name of the element file, if mass matrix
          preconditioning is desired, or else "none".
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>OUTPUT</b>: the program computes <b>basis_num</b> basis vectors.
      The first vector is written to the file <i>pod_001.txt</i>; again,
      the output vectors are written with two values per line, since
      this represents the two components of velocity at a particular
      node.
