    <p>
      <b>QUADRATURE_LEAST_SQUARES</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      computes weights for "sub-interpolatory" quadrature rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      A large class of quadrature rules may be computed by specifying
      a set of N abscissas, or sample points, X(1:N), determining the
      Lagrange interpolation basis functions L(1:N), and then setting
      a weight vector W by
      <pre>
        W(i) = I(L(i))
      </pre>
      after which, the integral of any function f(x) is estimated by
      <pre>
        I(f) \approx Q(f) = sum ( 1 <= i <= N ) W(i) * f(X(i))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We call this an interpolatory rule because the function f(x)
      has first been interpolated by 
      <pre>
        f(x) \approx sum ( 1 <= i <= N ) L(i) * f(X(i))
      </pre>
      after which, we apply the integration operator:
      <pre>
        I(f) \approx I(sum ( 1 <= i <= N )   L(i)  * f(X(i)))
             =         sum ( 1 <= i <= N ) I(L(i)) * f(X(i))
             =         sum ( 1 <= i <= N )   W(i)  * f(X(i)).
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For badly chosen sets of X, or high values of N, or unruly functions f(x),
      interpolation may be a bad way to approximate the function.  An 
      alternative is to seek a polynomial interpolant of degree D &lt; N-1,
      and then integrate that.  We might call this a "sub-interpolatory" rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      As it turns out, a natural way to seek such a rule is to write out
      the N by D+1 Vandermonde matrix and use a least squares solver.
      Even though the N by N Vandermonde matrix is ill-conditioned for 
      Gauss elimination, a least squares approach can produce usable solutions
      from the N by D+1 matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outline of this procedure was devised by Professor Mac Hyman
      of Tulane University.
