    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IHS_DATASET</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      creates an IHS dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Latin hypercube, in <b>M</b> dimensional space, with <b>N</b> points,
      can be thought of as being constructed by dividing each of the
      <b>M</b> coordinate dimensions into <b>N</b> equal intervals.  The
      J-th coordinate of the I-th point can be constructed by choosing, in
      the J-th dimension, an interval that has not been used, and then
      choosing any value in that interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      This algorithm differs in that it tries to pick a solution
      which has the property that the points are "spread out"
      as evenly as possible.  It does this by determining an optimal
      even spacing, and using the duplication factor D to allow it
      to choose the best of the various options available to it
      (the more duplication, the better chance of optimization).
    </p>

    <p>
      One drawback to this algorithm is that it requires an internal
      real distance array of dimension D * N * N.  For a relatively moderate
      problem with N = 1000, this can exceed the easily accessible
      memory.  Moreover, the program is inherently quadratic in N
      in execution time as well as memory; the computation of the I-th
      point in the set of N requires a consideration of the value of
      the coordinates used up by the previous points, and the distances
      from each of those points to the candidates for the next point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is interactive, and allows the user to choose
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b>, the spatial dimension;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>N</b>, the number of points to generate;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>D</b>, the duplication factor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SEED</b>, a seed for UNIFORM, the portable uniform random
          number generator used to make choices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Once these parameters are set, the program generates the data,
      and writes it to a file.  The user may then specify another
      set of data, or terminate the program.
