      SPHERE_DELAUNAY <br> Delaunay Triangulation on Unit Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_DELAUNAY</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      computes the Delaunay triangulation of points on the unit sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_DELAUNAY</b> takes as input an XYZ file, containing
      coordinates of points on the unit sphere in 3D.
      It passes this data to Renka's  STRIPACK library which
      computes the Delaunay triangulation.  The program then takes one
      "snapshot" of the triangulation, which is written to an
      EPS image file, and stores the line information that defines
      the Delaunay triangulation as an XYZL file.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven Fortune, it is possible to compute the Delaunay triangulation
      of points on a sphere by computing their convex hull.  If the sphere is the unit
      sphere at the origin, the facet normals are the Voronoi vertices.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote><code>
        <b>sphere_delaunay</b> <i>file.xyz</i>
      </code></blockquote>
      reads the XYZ file <i>file.xyz</i> containing the point coordinates,
      creates an EPS file <i>file.eps</i> containing a 2D projection of the Delaunay
      triangulation, and creates an XYZL file <i>file.xyzl</i> which can be used,
      in conjunction with <i>file.xyz</i> to display the 3D triangulation.
