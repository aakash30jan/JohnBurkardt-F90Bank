    <p>
      <b>http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/openmp_rcc/openmp_rcc.html</b>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>OPENMP_RCC</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      uses OpenMP parallel programming directives,
      and is to be run on the Florida State University (FSU)
      Research Computing Center (RCC) High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster,
      under the SLURM queue manager.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will assume you have a working OpenMP program, and an account
      on the FSU RCC system, that you have used SFTP to transfer a copy of
      your program source code (perhaps called "myprog.f90") to the HPC 
      login node, and that have used SSH to login to hpc-login.rcc.fsu.edu
      which is the interactive login node.
    </p>

    <p>
      The login node has 24 cores.  You are not supposed to use the login
      node for computation, since it is a shared resource where many users
      may be logged in, doing editing or compiling or other tasks.  However,
      it is reasonable to run a small version of your program with a few
      cores as a check.  To do this, you can interactively type commands
      like this (assuming that your program does not need a huge amount of
      memory or time!):
      <pre>
        gfortran -fopenmp myprog.f90
        mv a.out myprog
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
        ./myprog
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
        ./myprog
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's assume your program compiles, and that it runs substantially
      faster with 2 threads.  That means you are ready to run the full
      version of your program, which may need a lot more memory and time.
      But in that case, the program must be sent to a computational node,
      and your commands must be put into a command file, along with some
      information for the SLURM queue manager.      
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of a SLURM script, which might be called "myprog.sh":
      <pre>
        #!/bin/bash
        #SBATCH -N 1            <-- Ask for 1 node.  OpenMP can only run on 1 node.
        #SBATCH -c 8            <-- Ask for 8 cores, because we want 8 threads.
        #SBATCH -J myprog       <-- Name the job.
        #SBATCH -p backfill     <-- Use the "backfill" queue
        #SBATCH -t 00:15:00     <-- Time limit 15 minutes.
        gfortran -fopenmp -o myprog myprog.f90
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
        srun ./myprog           <-- "srun" must run your program.
      </pre>
      Note that the <b>srun</b> command is required in order to run your program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because an OpenMP program uses shared memory, all threads must be on the
      same node.  Thus, the number of cores you can access is limited by the
      number that are available on that node.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the FSU RCC HPC cluster, there are several kinds of nodes.
      INTEL nodes have 16 cores, "old" AMD nodes have 8 cores,
      and recent AMD nodes have 48 cores.  You can use the switch 
      "#SBATCH -C YEAR2010" to specify that you want a 48 core AMD node
      (more, but slower cores) or "#SBATCH -C intel" to specify that you want 
      a 16 core INTEL node (fewer, but faster, cores).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can compile your program interactively, in which case
      you can remove the compile instruction from the batch job.
    </p>

    <p>
      To submit the job to the queue, use the command
      <pre>
        sbatch myprog.sh
      </pre>
      You will see an immediate response like
      <pre>
        Submitted batch job 909856
      </pre>
      The number 909856 is an identifier for this job.  In particular,
      output from your program will be returned to you in a file called
      slurm-909856.out (although if you are picky you can ask SLURM to
      use a different naming convention).
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the output file may appear in your directory before the
      job is finished, containing the output "so far".  In some cases,
      you might want your program to print out a final "End of execution!"
      message just so you can know that it has completed normally.
    </p>

    <p>
      After you have submitted the job, and before it is complete, there are
      some useful SLURM commands:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>squeue</b> shows the status of the entire queue (too much information!);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>squeue | grep jburkardt</b> shows the status of all my jobs;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>squeue -u jburkardt</b> shows the status of all my jobs;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>scancel 909856</b> cancels job 909856;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>sacct -j 909856</b> reports on the status of this job, even after completion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>sacct -u jburkardt</b> reports on the status of all my jobs, even after completion.
        </li>
      </ul>
