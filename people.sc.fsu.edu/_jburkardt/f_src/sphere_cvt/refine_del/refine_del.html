    <P>
      We decided that the 32 soccer ball centers was a good start, but that
      we'd like to be able to refine the mesh.  One option is to draw the
      Delaunay triangulation, and add the midpoints of the lines.  This 
      produces a sequence of meshes of 32, 122, 482, .. points, adding
      3*N-6 points to the current set of N points for a total of
      4**K*(N-2)+2.
