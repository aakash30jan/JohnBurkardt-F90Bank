SCVT_MAIN
  A sample problem for the probabilistic
  Spherical Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation algorithm.
 
  Given a unit sphere in 3D, the problem is to determine
  a set of GENERATORS, that is, a set of points which 
  lie on the sphere, and which implicitly define a
  division of the surface into Voronoi cells.
  It is also desired that each generator point actually
  be the centroid of its cell.
 
SCVT Algorithm parameters:
-------------------------
 
  The number of Voronoi cells to generate:     32
  Number of iterations to determine CVT:   2000
  Number of sampling points: 160000
 
RANDOM_INITIALIZE
  Initialize RANDOM_NUMBER with user SEED =            1
 
  Initialize the Voronoi cell generators by...
  ...SOCCER BALL CENTERS (Requires N = 32)
