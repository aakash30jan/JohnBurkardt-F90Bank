    <P>
      Another method of refinement is to draw the Voronoi diagram, and 
      then add the vertices, producing a sequence of 32, 92, 272, ... 
      points, adding 2*N-4 points to the current set of N points for a 
      total of 3**K*(N-2)+2.  Here are the initial generators for both
      approaches:

      Files you may copy include:
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <A HREF = "refine_vor.xyz">refine_vor.xyz</A>, 
          the coordinates of the Voronoi once-refined mesh.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <A HREF = "refine_vor.iv">refine_vor.iv</A>, 
          an Inventor image of the points, with the added points in green.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <A HREF = "refine_vor2.xyz">refine_vor2.xyz</A>, 
          the coordinates of the Voronoi twice-refined mesh.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <A HREF = "refine_vor2.iv">refine_vor2.iv</A>, 
          an Inventor image of the points, with stage 0 points in red,
          stage 1 points in green and stage 2 points in yellow.
        </LI>
      </UL>
