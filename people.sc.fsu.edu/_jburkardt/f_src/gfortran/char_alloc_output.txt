CHAR_ALLOC:
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  Investigate some options for declaration of
  CHARACTER variables.
 
  Note that FORTRAN2003 allows the declaration of
  character variables with an allocatable LEN
  but for earlier FORTRAN's, this is NOT allowed!
 
TEST01
  Test the use of explicit LEN but unknown dimension:
 
  CHARACTER ( LEN = 1 ), ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION ( : ) ::CH_VEC
 
  We allocate 52 entries in the string.
 
  Here is the string after use:
 
  "AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPpQqRrSsTtUuVvWwXxYyZz"
 
TEST02
  Test the use of explicit LEN but unknown dimension:
 
  CHARACTER ( LEN = 2 ), ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION ( : ) ::CH_VEC
 
  We allocate 26 entries in the string.
 
  Here is the string after use:
 
  "AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPpQqRrSsTtUuVvWwXxYyZz"
