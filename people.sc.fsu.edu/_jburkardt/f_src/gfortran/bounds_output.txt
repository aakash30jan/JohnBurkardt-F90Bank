Fortran runtime error: Index '11' of dimension 1 of array 'a' above upper bound of 10
 
BOUNDS:
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  This program uses an illegal memory reference.
  In this case, an array element A(11) is read,
  although the array is only dimensioned for size 10.
 
  Compilation with the GFORTRAN switch -fbounds-check
  will generate a run-time warning.
