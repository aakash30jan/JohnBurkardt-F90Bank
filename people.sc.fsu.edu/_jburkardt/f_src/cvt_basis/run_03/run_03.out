CVT_BASIS
  Arrange a set abstract data vectors into clusters.
 
  This NEW version of the code handles up to
    10 families of data.
 
  Null cluster policy:
  0, do nothing, accept null clusters;
  1, reset center to a random data point;
  2, reset center to random point in hull;
 
  NULL_CLUSTER_POLICY =      1
 
RANDOM_INITIALIZE
  Initialize RANDOM_NUMBER with user SEED =    123456789
 
  It is time to read sets of solution files.
 
  We assume that a series of solution files exists,
  with "consecutive" names, like
    fred001.txt, fred002,txt, ...
  Just specify the FIRST name in the series, and
  the program will read them all.
 
  The program can read another series of data if
  you specify yet another first name, or you can
  type "none" when there are no more file series.
 
 
What is the first solution file (in the first series)?
 
What is the first solution file (in the NEXT series) or "NONE"?
 
  The number of initial solution files is      1
  The total number of solution files is     40
 
  The data is stored in an M by N matrix.
 
  The "spatial" dimension M is       41
  The number of data points N is     40
 
 
  Processing files starting with "/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/datasets/burgers/burgers_01.txt".
 
  All the data has been read into POINT.
 
Enter lower and upper number of clusters
 DEBUG: CLUSTER_LO =            8  cluster_hi =            8
 
  The program will try to determine the minimum energy
  of a clustering, for cluster sizes in the range:
       8     8
 
Enter the number of different random cluster configurations to check
 
  For each number of clusters, the number of
  distinct initial random configurations to be checked
  will be      15
 
Enter the number of energy iterations
 
  For each initial random configuration, the number of
  times the program will recompute the cluster centers,
  cluster components, and energy is     30
 
Number of clusters allowed:      8
