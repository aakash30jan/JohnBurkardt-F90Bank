      SEQUENCE <br> Fill in a Sequence
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SEQUENCE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a numeric sequence with missing values,
      and fills in the missing values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The input to the program is a string representing a sequence,
      with missing values denoted by question marks.  For instance,
      we might enter the following sequence:
      <pre>
        ? 3 6 ? 15
      </pre>
      The program will try to determine the simplest rule of a certain
      kind that can be used to fill in the question marks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rule deduced for the sequence is found by constructing the
      polynomial that interpolates the known data.  Abscissas for the
      data are assigned by position in the sequence.  Thus for the
      above sequence, the three known values have abscissas of 2, 3
      and 5, which means we might think of the sequence as a table:
      <table "border" = 1>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>?</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>?</td><td>15</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the interpolating polynomial is found, it is evaluated at
      the points where data was not given, and the results are reported
      back to the user.  In the example case, we would get the
      filled in sequence:
      <pre>
        1 3 6 10 15
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this procedure will always be able to produce a result,
      but it may not be the expected result.  This is particularly so
      when the sequence is most easily represented in terms of a geometric
      calculation, as in
      <pre>
        1 2 4 8 16 32
      </pre>
      or as in the Fibonacci sequence:
      <pre>
        1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
      </pre>
      both of which this program will be unable to recognize.
