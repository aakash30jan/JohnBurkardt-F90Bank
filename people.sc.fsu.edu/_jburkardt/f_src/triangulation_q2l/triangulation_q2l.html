      TRIANGULATION_Q2L <br> 6-Node Triangulation to 3-Node Triangulation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_Q2L</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads information 
      describing a triangulation of a set of points using 6-node
      ("quadratic") triangles, and creates a 3-node ("linear")
      triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same nodes are used, but each 6-node triangle is broken
      up into four smaller 3-node triangles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the program might be given the following 4 triangles:
      <pre>
        11-12-13-14-15
         |\    |\    |
         | \   | \   |
         6  7  8  9 10
         |   \ |   \ |
         |    \|    \|
         1--2--3--4--5
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      It would make a new triangulation involving 16 triangles:
      <pre>
        11-12-13-14-15
         |\ |\ |\ |\ |
         | \| \| \| \|
         6--7--8--9-10
         |\ |\ |\ |\ |
         | \| \| \| \|
         1--2--3--4--5
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input and output files use the simple 
      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/table/table.html">TABLE format</a>;
      comment lines begin with a "#" character.  Otherwise, each line
      of the file contains one set of information, either the coordinates
      of a node (for a node file), or the indices of nodes that make up
      a triangle, (for a triangle file).
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt</i> contains the triangle information
      for the 6-node triangulation.  Each line contains the indices of six
      nodes that form a triangle, in counterclockwise order.  The first three
      indices are the vertices, in counterclockwise order.  The fourth
      index is the midside node between vertices 1 and 2, the fifth
      the midside between vertices 2 and 3, and the sixth the midside
      between vertices 3 and 1.  
    </p>

    <p> 
      The output file <i>prefix</i>_q2l_elements.txt contains the triangle 
      information for the 3-node triangulation.  The vertices for
      each triangle are listed in counterclockwise order.  There are
      4 times as many triangles in this triangulation.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangulation_q2l</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common filename prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node coordinates (not needed by this program),
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt contains the quadratic element definitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_q2l_elements.txt will contain the linear element 
          definitions, based on the same set of nodes.
        </li>
      </ul>
