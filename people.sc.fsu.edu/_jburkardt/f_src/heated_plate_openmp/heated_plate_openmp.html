      HEATED_PLATE_OPENMP <br> 2D Steady State Heat Equation Using OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HEATED_PLATE_OPENMP</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      illustrates the use of the OpenMP application program interface
      by employing an iteration that solves the 2D steady state
      heat equation.
    </p>

    <p>  
      The sequential version of this program needs approximately
      18/eps iterations to complete. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
      by this diagram;
      <pre>
                     W = 0
               +------------------+
               |                  |
      W = 100  |                  | W = 100
               |                  |
               +------------------+
                     W = 100
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The region is covered with a grid of M by N nodes, and an N by N
      array W is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
      array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
      indices of the four corners:
      <pre>
                    I = 0
            [0][0]-------------[0][N-1]
               |                  |
        J = 0  |                  |  J = N-1
               |                  |
          [M-1][0]-----------[M-1][N-1]
                    I = M-1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>  
      The steady state solution to the discrete heat equation satisfies the
      following condition at an interior grid point:
      <pre>
        W[Central] = (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
      </pre>
      where "Central" is the index of the grid point, "North" is the index
      of its immediate neighbor to the "north", and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given an approximate solution of the steady state heat equation, a
      "better" solution is given by replacing each interior point by the
      average of its 4 neighbors - in other words, by using the condition
      as an ASSIGNMENT statement:
      <pre>
        W[Central]  <=  (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
      </pre>
      If this process is repeated often enough, the difference between successive 
      estimates of the solution will go to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program carries out such an iteration, using a tolerance specified by
      the user, and writes the final estimate of the solution to a file that can
      be used for graphic processing.
