      ASA136 <br> The K-Means Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ASA136</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      divides M points in N dimensions into K clusters
      so that the within-clusters sum of squares is minimized,
      by Hartigan and Wong.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>ASA136</b> is Applied Statistics Algorithm 136.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the K-Means problem, a set of N points X(I) in M-dimensions is
      given.  The goal is to arrange these points into K clusters,
      with each cluster having a representative point Z(J), usually
      chosen as the centroid of the points in the cluster.  The energy
      of each cluster is <pre>
        E(J) = Sum ( all points X(I) in cluster J ) || X(I) - Z(J) ||^2
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a given set of clusters, the total energy is then simply
      the sum of the cluster energies E(J).  The goal is to choose the
      clusters in such a way that the total energy is minimized.
      Usually, a point X(I) goes into the cluster with the closest
      representative point Z(J).  So to define the clusters, it's
      enough simply to specify the locations of the cluster representatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is actually a fairly hard problem.  Most algorithms do
      reasonably well, but cannot guarantee that the best solution
      has been found.  It is very common for algorithms to get
      stuck at a solution which is merely a "local minimum".
      For such a local minimum, every slight rearrangement of
      the solution makes the energy go up; however a major
      rearrangement would result in a big drop in energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple algorithm for the problem is known as "H-Means".
      It alternates between two procedures:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Using the given cluster centers, assign each point to the
          cluster with the nearest center;
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the given cluster assignments, replace each cluster
          center by the centroid or average of the points in the cluster.
        </li>
      </ul>
      These steps are repeated until no points are moved, or some
      other termination criterion is reached.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more sophisticated algorithm, known as "K-Means", takes advantage
      of the fact that it is possible to quickly determine the decrease in
      energy caused by moving a point from its current cluster to another.
      It repeats the following procedure:
      <ul>
        <li>
          For each point, move it to another cluster if that would lower
          the energy.  If you move a point, immediately update the
          cluster centers of the two affected clusters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This procedure is repeated until no points are moved, or some
      other termination criterion is reached.
