      PCE_BURGERS <br> Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Burgers Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PCE_BURGERS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      defines and solves a version of the time-dependent viscous Burgers equation,
      with uncertain viscosity, using a polynomial chaos expansion, 
      in terms of Hermite polynomials,
      by Gianluca Iaccarino.
    </p>

    <p>
      The time-dependent viscous Burgers equation to be solved is:
      <pre>
        du/dt = - d ( u*(1/2-u)) /dx + nu d2u/dx2  for -3.0 <= x <= 3.0
      </pre>
      with boundary conditions
      <pre>
        u(-3.0) = 0.0, u(+3.0) = 1.0.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The viscosity nu is assumed to be an uncertain quantity with
      normal distribution of known mean and variance.
    </p>

    <p>
      A polynomial chaos expansion is to be used, with Hermite polynomial
      basis functions h(i,x), 0 <= i <= n.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the first two Hermite polynomials are simply 1 and x, 
      we have that 
      <pre>
        nu = nu_mean * h(0,x) + nu_variance * h(1,x).
      </pre>
      We replace the time derivative by an explicit Euler approximation,
      so that the equation now describes the value of U(x,t+dt) in terms
      of known data at time t.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now assume that the solution U(x,t) can be approximated
      by the truncated expansion:
      <pre>
        U(x,t) = sum ( 0 <= i <= n ) c(i,t) * h(i,x)
      </pre>
      In the equation, we replace U by its expansion, and then multiply
      successively by each of the basis functions h(*,x) to get a set of
      n+1 equations that can be used to determine the values of c(i,t+dt).
    </p>

    <p>
      This process is repeated until the desired final time is reached.
    </p>

    <p>
      At any time, the coefficients c(0,t) contain information definining
      the expected value of u(x,t) at that time, while the higher order coefficients
      can be used to determine higher moments.
