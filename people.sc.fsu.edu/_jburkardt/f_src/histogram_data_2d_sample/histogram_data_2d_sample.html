      HISTOGRAM_DATA_2D_SAMPLE <br> Create and Sample a PDF Based on Sample 2D Data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HISTOGRAM_DATA_2D_SAMPLE</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      demonstrates how to construct a Probability Density Function (PDF)
      from a table of sample data over a 2D region, and then to use that PDF 
      to create new samples.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program presented here is hard-wired to handle a specific problem.
      However, the ideas used in the program are easily extended to other regions
      and other dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the problem given here, we assume we have sample values of a function
      <b>F(X,Y)</b> for each subregion of a region.  These values might actually
      represent population counts, a density, the integral of some function over
      the subregion, or simply an abstract function.  We implicitly assumed that
      all the values are positive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The particular region studied here is the unit square, which has been
      broken down into a 20x20 array of equal subsquares.  
    </p>

    <p>
      If we normalize by the sum of the data values, the result is a PDF
      associated with each subregion.
      By assigning an arbitrary order to the subregions, we can add the PDF
      values up to the given subregion to get a CDF (cumulative density function)
      for that subregion.  Now given an arbitrary random value U, we can locate
      the subregion whose CDF value just exceeds U.  Choosing a random point
      within this subregion gives us the sample point.  If we choose many such
      sample points, the statistics for this sample will tend to the discrete
      PDF that we defined from the data we were given.
