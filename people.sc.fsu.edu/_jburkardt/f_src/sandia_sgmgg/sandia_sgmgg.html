    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SANDIA_SGMGG</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      contains some experimental code for the investigation of sparse
      grids constructed in a generalized fashion, in which the set of
      indices corresponding to a sparse grid is chosen in a generalized
      way, rather than being defined by a linear constraint.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sparse grid is associated with a data structure, whose management
      is a significant part of the computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      We assume we are working in a space of dimension <b>ND</b>.  An
      index vector is a list of <b>ND</b> nonnegative integers, which
      represent the level of quadrature in each dimension.  A single 
      index vector can be used to construct a product rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      A sparse grid can be thought of as a weighted summation of product
      rules; our represention of a sparse grid will then consist of a list 
      of <b>NI</b> index vectors, which we can regard as an <b>ND</b> by 
      <b>NI</b> array.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not every collection of index vectors will be admissible.  For our
      purposes, a collection of index vectors is admissible if each vector
      in the set is admissible.  An index vector that is part of a collection
      is admissible if it is the 0 vector, or every vector formed by
      decrementing exactly one entry by 1 is an admissible vector in the set.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of an admissible collection of index vectors in 2D:
      <pre>
        (0,3)
        (0,2) (1,2)
        (0,1) (1,1)
        (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0)
      </pre>
      For the 2D case, an index is admissible if every possible index below
      or to the left of it is also in the set.
