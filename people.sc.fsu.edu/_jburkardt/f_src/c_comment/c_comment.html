      C_COMMENT <br> Reformat C++ comments to C style
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>C_COMMENT</b> is a FORTRAN90 program
      which reads an ASCII text file,
      and writes a copy, in which C++ style comments have been replaced by
      equivalent C-style comments.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>c_comment</b> <i>input_file</i> <i>output_file</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>input_file</i> is the file to read;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>output_file</i> is the file to create;
        </li>
