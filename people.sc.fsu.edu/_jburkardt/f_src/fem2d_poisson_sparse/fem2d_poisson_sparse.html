      FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE <br>
      Finite Element Solution of Poisson's Equation <br>
      on a Triangulated Region<br>
      using a Sparse Matrix Solver
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      applies the finite element method to solve
      a form of Poisson's equation over an arbitrary triangulated region,
      using sparse matrix storage and an iterative solver.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Sparse Matrix Modifications:
    </h3>

    <p>
      This program is a revised version of <b>FEM2D_POISSON</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_POISSON</b> used a direct LINPACK/LAPACK banded matrix
      solver.  The storage requirements for the banded solver are less than
      for a full storage solver, but still grow quickly as the
      problem size increases.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE</b> reduces the storage requirements even further,
      by using sparse matrix techniques.  The storage format chosen is
      known as <b>DSP</b> or "sparse triplet" format, which essentially
      simply saves in three vectors A, IA, JA, which record the value,
      row and column of every nonzero entry.  To solve the linear system,
      the <b>MGMRES</b> iterative solver was applied.  With these
      modifications, <b>FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE</b> can handle problems much larger
      than those that <b>FEM2D_POISSON</b> could.  A new issue
      is that the iterative solver must be monitored to ensure that
      convergence is proceeding properly, and has reached the desired
      tolerance.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      The Triangulated Region:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The computational region is unknown by the program.  The user
      specifies it by preparing a file containing the coordinates of
      the nodes, and a file containing the indices of nodes that make
      up triangles that form a triangulation of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, the user does not type in this information by hand, but has
      a program fill in the nodes, and perhaps another program that
      constructs the triangulation.  However, in the simplest case,
      the user might construct a very crude triangulation by hand, and
      have 
      TRIANGULATION_REFINE refine it to something more reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the following ridiculously small example:
      <pre>
        4----5
        |\   |\
        | \  | \
        |  \ |  \
        |   \|   \
        1----2----3
      </pre>
      the node file would be:
      <pre>
         0.0 0.0
         1.0 0.0
         2.0 0.0
         0.0 1.0
         1.0 1.0
      </pre>
      and the triangle file would be
      <pre>
        1 2 4
        5 4 2
        2 3 5
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      The Poisson Equation:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The program is set up to handle the linear Poisson
      equation with a right hand side function, and nonhomogeneous
      Dirichlet boundary conditions.   The state variable
      U(X,Y) is then constrained by:
      <pre>
        - Del H(x,y) Del U(x,y) + K(x,y) * U(x,y) = F(x,y)  inside the region;
                                           U(x,y) = G(x,y)  on the boundary.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A fancier version of the program is eventually intended, which will
      handle a more interesting nonlinear PDE, and include optional Neumann
      boundary conditions.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      User Interface:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To specify the boundary condition function G(x,y),
      the linear coefficients H(x,y) and K(x,y) and the right hand side function F(x,y),
      the user has to modify a file containing three subroutines,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE DIRICHLET_CONDITION ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, NODE_BC )</b>
          evaluates G(X,Y).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE H_COEF ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, NODE_H )</b>
          evaluates H(x,y).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE K_COEF ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, NODE_K )</b>
          evaluates K(x,y).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE RHS ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, NODE_F )</b>
          evaluates F(x,y).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the program, the user compiles the user routines,
      links them with <b>FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE</b>, and runs the executable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program writes out a file containing an Encapsulated
      PostScript image of the nodes and elements, with numbers.
      If there are too many nodes, the plot may be too cluttered
      to read.  For lower values, however, it is
      a valuable map of what is going on in the geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is also able to write out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The user must create an executable by compiling the user routines
      and linking them with the main program, perhaps by commands like:
      <pre>
        gfortran -c fem2d_poisson_sparse.f90
        gfortran -c user.f90
        gfortran fem2d_poisson_sparse.o user.o
        mv a.out fem2d_poisson_sparse
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming the executable program is called "fem2d_poisson_sparse", then
      the program is executed by
      <blockquote>
        <b>fem2d_poisson_sparse</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where prefix is the common filename prefix, so that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>, is a file containing the node coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b>, is a file listing the 3 nodes that
          make up each element;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
