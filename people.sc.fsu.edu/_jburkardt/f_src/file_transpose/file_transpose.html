    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FILE_TRANSPOSE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      creates a "transposed" copy of a file, in which, essentially, the I-th
      word of the J-th line becomes the J-th word of the I-th line.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>file_transpose</b> <i>input</i> <i>output</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>input</i> is the name of the input file,
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>output</i> is the name of the output file to be created.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if the input file is:
      <pre>
        Apple Ball    Carrot Doll
         Egg    Fig  1.23456,  Haystack
        Iodine 
               Joystick Kahlua Lompoc     Millipede Negatory
      </pre>
      the transposed file will be:
      <pre>
        Apple Egg Iodine Joystick
        Ball Fig Kahlua
        Carrot 1.23456, Lompoc
        Doll Haystack Millipede
        Negatory
      </pre>
    </p>

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>PIGS</b> is a simple demonstration of the program.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "pigs.txt">pigs.txt</a>,
          a simple file of 3 lines of 4 words, 4 words, and 3 words respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "pigs_transposed.txt">pigs_transposed.txt</a>,
          the transposed file, containing 4 lines of 3 words, 3 words, 3 words and 2 words
          respectively.  Because the lines are almost all the same length, it's not hard
          to read the story this way.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>STORY</b> suggests that the program is not so useful when working with
      ragged text.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "story.txt">story.txt</a>,
          a file containing blank lines and lines of greatly varying numbers of words.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "story_transposed.txt">story_transposed.txt</a>,
          the transposed file.  Because the input text was "ragged", it's not easy to
          read the text now, nor would it be easy to reconstruct the original file!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MATRIX</b> illustrates how a numeric table or matrix can be transposed.
      In fact, this is the application for which the FILE_TRANSPOSE program was written.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "matrix.txt">matrix.txt</a>,
          a file containing 30 lines, each containing 10 numeric values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "matrix_transposed.txt">matrix_transposed.txt</a>,
          the transposed file, with 10 lines of 30 values.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
