      PRAXIS <br> Scalar Function Optimization
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PRAXIS</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 library which 
      minimizes a scalar function of a vector argument,
      without needing derivative information,
      by Richard Brent.
    </p>

    <p>
      PRAXIS seeks an M-dimensional point X which minimizes a
      given scalar function F(X).  The code is a refinement 
      of Powell's method of conjugate search directions.  The user
      does not need to supply the partial derivatives of the function
      F(X).  In fact, the function F(X) need not be
      smoothly differentiable.
