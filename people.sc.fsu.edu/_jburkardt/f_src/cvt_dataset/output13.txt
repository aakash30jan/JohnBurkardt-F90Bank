CVT_DATASET (FORTRAN90 version)
  Generate a CVT dataset.
 
  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.
 
  The program requests input values from the user:
 
  * NDIM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * SEED, a seed to use for random number generation,
  * INIT, initialize the points:
    ** file, read data from a file;
    ** GRID, by picking points from a grid;
    ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
    ** RANDOM, using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
    ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
  * IT_MAX, the maximum number of iterations.
  * IT_FIXED, the number of iterative steps to take
    using a fixed set of sampling points.
  * SAMPLE, how to conduct the sampling.
    ** GRID, by picking points from a grid;
    ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
    ** RANDOM, using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
    ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
  * SAMPLE_NUM, the number of sample points.
  * BATCH, number of sample points to create at one time.
  * OUTPUT, a file in which to store the data.
 
  To indicate that no further computations are 
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value, 
  such as -1.

  Enter NDIM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try '2' if you do not have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input NDIM =            2
 
  Enter N, the number of points to generate:
  (Try '25' if you do not have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input N =           85
 
  Enter SEED, a seed for the random number generator:
  (Try '123456789' if you do not have a preference.)
  (Any negative value terminates execution).
  User input SEED =    123456789
 
  INIT is the method of initializing the data:
 
  file     read data from a file;
  GRID     by picking points from a grid;
  HALTON   from a Halton sequence;
  RANDOM   using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
  UNIFORM  using a simple uniform RNG;
 
  (Try 'RANDOM' if you do not have a preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
 
  Enter INIT:
  User input INIT = "uniform".
 
  IT_MAX is the maximum number of iterations.
 
  An iteration carries out the following steps:
  * the Voronoi region associated with each
    generator is estimated by sampling;
  * the centroid of each Voronoi region is estimated.
  * the generator is replaced by the centroid.
 
  If "enough" sampling points are used,
  and "enough" iterations are taken, this process
  will converge.
 
  (Try '50' if you do not have a preference.)
  (A negative value terminates execution).
 
  Enter IT_MAX:
  User input IT_MAX =    100
 
  IT_FIXED is the number of consecutive iterations
  to take with a fixed set of sample points.
 
  Setting IT_FIXED to 1 means a new set of sample
  points is generated on every iterative step;
  Setting IT_FIXED equal to IT_MAX means a single set
  of sample points is used for the entire iteration.
 
  Any value between 1 and IT_MAX is reasonable.
 
  (Try    100 if you do not have a preference.)
  (A 0 or negative value terminates execution).
 
  Enter IT_FIXED:
  User input IT_FIXED =     25
 
  SAMPLE is the method of sampling the region:
 
  GRID     by picking points from a grid;
  HALTON   from a Halton sequence;
  RANDOM   using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
  UNIFORM  using a simple uniform RNG;
 
  (Try 'RANDOM' if you do not have a preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
 
  Enter SAMPLE:
  User input SAMPLE = "uniform".
 
  SAMPLE_NUM is the number of sample points.
 
  The Voronoi regions will be explored by generating
  SAMPLE_NUM points.  For each sample point, the
  nearest generator is found.  Using more points
  gives a better estimate of these regions.
 
  SAMPLE_NUM should be much larger than N, the
  number of generators.
 
  (Try '10000' if you do not have a preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)
 
  Enter SAMPLE_NUM:
  User input SAMPLE_NUM =       100000
 
  BATCH is the number of sample points to create
  at one time.
 
  BATCH should be between 1 and SAMPLE_NUM.
 
  It is FASTER to set BATCH to SAMPLE_NUM;
  setting BATCH to 1 requires the least memory.
 
  (Try         1000 if you do not have a preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)
 
  Enter BATCH:
  User input BATCH =         1000
 
  OUTPUT is the name of a file into which
  the computed data may be stored.
 
  (Try 'cvt.txt' if you do not have a preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
 
  Enter OUTPUT:
  User input OUTPUT = "cvt13.txt".
 
  The data was written to the file "cvt13.txt".

*  Ready to generate a new dataset:
 *
  *
  Enter NDIM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try '2' if you do not have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input NDIM =           -1
 
CVT_DATASET
  The input value of NDIM =           -1
  is interpreted as a request for termination.
  Normal end of execution.
 
  Final value of SEED =   1118006509
