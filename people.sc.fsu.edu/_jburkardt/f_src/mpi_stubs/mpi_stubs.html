      MPI_STUBS <br> Dummy MPI Library
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MPI_STUBS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      provides "stub" versions of some MPI routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MPI_STUBS</b> is intended to include stubs for the most commonly
      called MPI routines.  Most of the stub routines don't do anything.
      In a few cases, where it makes sense, they do some simple action
      or return a value that is appropriate for the serial processing
      case.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MPI_STUBS</b> can be used as a convenience, when a real MPI
      implementation is not available, and the user simply wants to
      test-compile a code.  It may also be useful in those occasions
      when a code has been so carefully written that it will still
      execute correctly on a single processor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MPI_STUBS</b> is based on a similar package supplied as
      part of the <b>LAMMPS</b> program, which allow that program to
      be compiled, linked and run on a single processor machine,
      although it is normally intended for parallel execution.
