      SPRING_ODE <br> Line Printer Graphics to Display Spring ODE Solution
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPRING_ODE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      shows how line printer graphics can be used to make a crude illustration
      of a solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes
      the motion of a weight attached to a spring.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a simple example of how to plot when you don't have a plotter.
      This is a particular kind of "ASCII graphics", or "typewriter graphics"
      or "lineprinter graphics", and shows you how valuable an illustration 
      can be, even when it's as crude as this example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hooke's law for a spring observes that the restoring force is
      proportional to the displacement: 
      <pre>
        F = - k x
      </pre>
      and Newton's law relates the force to acceleration:
      <pre>
        F = m a
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Putting these equations together, we have:
      <pre>
        m * d^2 x/dt^2 = - k * x
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can add a damping force with coefficient c:
      <pre>
        m * d^2 x/dt^2 = - k * x - c * dx/dt
      </pre>
      If we write this as a pair of first order equations for (x,v), we have
      <pre>
            dx/dt = v
        m * dv/dt = - k * x - c * v
      </pre>
      and now we can approximate these values for small time steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the plotting assumes that the value of X will always be
      between -1 and +1.  If the initial condition uses V = 0, and X starts
      between -1 and +1, then this will be OK.
