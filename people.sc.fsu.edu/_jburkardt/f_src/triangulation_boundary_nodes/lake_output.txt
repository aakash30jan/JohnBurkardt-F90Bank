TRIANGULATION_BOUNDARY_NODES
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Identify triangulation nodes that lie on the boundary.
 
* Read a node dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions;
 
* Read an associated triangulation dataset of  
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes;
 
* Determine which nodes are on the boundary;
 
* Write a file which is 1 for each boundary node.
 
  Read the header of "lake_nodes.txt".
 
  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =        2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM  =      621
 
  Read the data in "lake_nodes.txt".

MESH_BASE_ONE:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  No conversion is necessary.
 
  Number of boundary nodes is      268
 
  Wrote the node boundary value file "lake_boundarynodes.txt".
