  FORTRAN90 version
  Read a node file of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangulation file of TRIANGLE_NUM 
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.
 
  For each triangle, call a user masking routine
  to see if the triangle should be MASKED (not shown).
 
  Write new node and triangulation files corresponding
  to the unmasked data only.
