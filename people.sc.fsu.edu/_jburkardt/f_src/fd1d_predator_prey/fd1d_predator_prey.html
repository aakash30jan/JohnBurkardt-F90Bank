    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_PREDATOR_PREY</b>
      is an FORTRAN90 program which
      solves a predator-prey system in a one dimensional region,
      creating graphics files for processing by GNUPLOT,
      by Marcus Garvie.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program requires both some interactive input from the user, and
      two simple FORTRAN90 routines that define the initial values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nondimensional problem has the form
      <pre>
        du/dt =         del u + ( 1 - u ) * u        - v * h(u/alpha)

        dv/dt = delta * del v     - gamma * v + beta * v * h(u/alpha)
      </pre>
      with initial conditions:
      <pre>
        u(x,0) = u0(x)
        v(x,0) = v0(x)
      </pre>
      and boundary conditions at the left and right endpoints [A,B]:
      <pre>
        du/dx = 0
        dv/dx = 0
      </pre>
      The Type II functional response employed here is
      <pre>
        h(eta) = eta / ( 1 + eta )
      </pre>
      The parameters ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA and DELTA are strictly positive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user must input a value H specifying the desired space step
      to be used in discretizing the space dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      A finite difference scheme is employed to integrate the problem
      from time 0 to a maximum time T.  The user must input the value
      T, as well as an appropriate time step DELT.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical input for this problem is:
      <pre>
        ALPHA =   0.3
        BETA  =   2.0
        GAMMA =   0.8
        DELTA =   1.0
        A     =   0.0
        B     = 200.0
        H     =   0.5
        T     =  40.0
        DELT  =   0.0104
        GAUSS =   0        (0 = direct solution, 1 = Jacobi )
      </pre>
      with the following initial values of U and V supplied in
      auxiliary subroutines:
      <pre>
        u0(1:n) = exp ( - ( x(1:n) - 100.0 )**2 ) / 5.0
        v0(1:n) = 2.0 / 5.0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The user is prompted for all the necessary parameters, time and
      space-steps.  The formulas for the initial values of the functions
      U and V must be supplied by two FORTRAN90 subroutines.
