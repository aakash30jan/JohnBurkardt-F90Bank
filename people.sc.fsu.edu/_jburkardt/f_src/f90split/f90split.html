      F90SPLIT <br> Split FORTRAN90 Source Files
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>F90SPLIT</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which 
      reads a (simple) FORTRAN90 source code, and writes each routine 
      to a separate file with an extension of ".f90".
    </p>

    <p>  
      Here, by "routine", we mean a chunk of text that begins with
      a <b>BLOCKDATA</b>, <b>FUNCTION</b>, <b>MODULE</b>, 
      <b>PROGRAM</b> or <b>SUBROUTINE</b> unit and ends with an <b>END</b> 
      statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      This utility can be convenient when your goal is to create a
      UNIX "AR" archive of the compiled object code.  By splitting
      your source code up, and compiling each routine separately,
      you end up with a library in which each compiled module is
      individual listed and replaceable.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>f90split</b> <i>myprog.f90</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>myprog.f90</i> is the file to be split.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of the name of a single file, a pattern can be given, 
      as in:
      <blockquote>
        <b>f90split</b> <i>sub*.f90</i>
      </blockquote>
      in which case each file whose name matches the pattern will
      be handled by the program.

    <p>
      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/catalog/catalog.html">
      CATALOG</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 program and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.

    <p>
      <a href = "../extract/extract.html">
      EXTRACT</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      extracts a subroutine, function or module by name from a 
      FORTRAN file.

      <a href = "../fixcon/fixcon.html">
      FIXCON</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a FORTRAN file using FORTRAN77 continuation statements,
      and makes a copy that uses FORTRAN90 continuation instead.

      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/htmlindex/htmlindex.html">
      HTMLINDEX</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a FORTRAN program and writes a skeleton HTML page describing it,
      assuming that each subroutine includes a '!!' or 'cc' description line.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../include_files/include_files.html">
      INCLUDE_FILES</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which 
      reads a FORTRAN program with INCLUDE
      statements, and makes a copy with the indicated files included.

    <p>
      <a href = "../module_mark/module_mark.html">
      MODULE_MARK</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
