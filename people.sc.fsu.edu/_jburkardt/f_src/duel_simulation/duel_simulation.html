      DUEL_SIMULATION <br> Simulation of a Duel
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DUEL_SIMULATION</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      simulates N instances of a duel between two players.
    </p>

    <p>
      Player A fires at player B, and hits with a probability of A_ACCURACY.
      If Player A misses, then Player B fires at Player A, hitting with
      a probability of B_ACCURACY.
    </p>

    <p>
      The duel continues with alternating shots until only one player
      survives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simulation is intended to estimate the probabilities that a
      player will survive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exact probability that player 1 will survive is
      <blockquote>
        P(1) / ( P(1) + P(2) - P(1) * P(2) )
      </blockquote>
      while player 2's chance is
      <blockquote>
        P(2) * ( 1 - P(1) ) / ( P(1) + P(2) - P(1) * P(2) ).
      </blockquote>
