    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>INCLUDE_FILES</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      makes a copy of a FORTRAN file, in which INCLUDE statements
      are replaced by the corresponding include files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format for a FORTRAN include statement is either
      <pre><b>
        <b>include</b> '<i>file.txt</i>'
      </b></pre>
      or
      <pre><b>
        <b>include</b> "<i>file.txt</i>"
      </b></pre>
      This program reads a file with such include statements, and
      replaces each such occurrence by the text of the corresponding file.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>include_files</b> <i>file1.f</i> <i>file2.f</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the file <i>file1.f</i> and creates a copy <i>file2.f</i>
          with all available INCLUDE files included.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>include_files</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          asks the user for the names of the files <i>file1.f</i> and
          <i>file2.f</i>.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/catalog/catalog.html">
      CATALOG</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 program and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../extract/extract.html">
      EXTRACT</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      extracts a subroutine, function
      or module by name from a FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 file.

    <p>
      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/f77split/f77split.html">
      F77SPLIT</a>,
      a C program which
      reads a FORTRAN77 file and creates
      individual files for every subroutine or function in the file.

    <p>
      <a href = "../fixcon/fixcon.html">
      FIXCON</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a FORTRAN file that uses
      FORTRAN77 continuation statements,
      and makes a copy that uses FORTRAN90 continuation instead.

      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/htmlindex/htmlindex.html">
      HTMLINDEX</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 program
      and writes a skeleton HTML page describing it, assuming that each
      subroutine includes a '!!' or 'cc' description line.

    <p>
      <a href = "../module_mark/module_mark.html">
      MODULE_MARK</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
