      HEATED_PLATE_WORKSHARE <br> 2D Steady State Heat Equation Using OpenMP WORKSHARE
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HEATED_PLATE_WORKSHARE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      illustrates the use of OpenMP's WORKSHARE directive for
      parallelizing FORTRAN array commands.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        While the WORKSHARE directive has been part of the OpenMP standard
        for a considerable time, it does not seem to be well supported by
        vendors, perhaps in part because it is peculiar to FORTRAN, and
        not allowed in C.  In any case, the example discussed here seems
        to show no improvement at all over the sequential code, when
        compiled using the Gnu gfortran compiler or the Intel ifort compiler!
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
      by this diagram;
      <pre>
                     W = 0
               +------------------+
               |                  |
      W = 100  |                  | W = 100
               |                  |
               +------------------+
                     W = 100
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The region is covered with a grid of M by N nodes, and an N by N
      array W is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
      array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
      indices of the four corners:
      <pre>
                    I = 0
            [0][0]-------------[0][N-1]
               |                  |
        J = 0  |                  |  J = N-1
               |                  |
          [M-1][0]-----------[M-1][N-1]
                    I = M-1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The steady state solution to the discrete heat equation satisfies the
      following condition at an interior grid point:
      <pre>
        W[Central] = (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
      </pre>
      where "Central" is the index of the grid point, "North" is the index
      of its immediate neighbor to the "north", and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given an approximate solution of the steady state heat equation, a
      "better" solution is given by replacing each interior point by the
      average of its 4 neighbors - in other words, by using the condition
      as an ASSIGNMENT statement:
      <pre>
        W[Central]  <=  (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
      </pre>
      If this process is repeated often enough, the difference between successive
      estimates of the solution will go to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program carries out such an iteration, using a tolerance specified by
      the user, and writes the final estimate of the solution to a file that can
      be used for graphic processing.
