!! ADDCST adds constraint curves to a Delaunay triangulation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This subroutine provides for creation of a constrained
!    Delaunay triangulation which, in some sense, covers an
!    arbitrary connected region R rather than the convex hull
!    of the nodes.  This is achieved simply by forcing the
!    presence of certain adjacencies (triangulation arcs) 
!    corresponding to constraint curves.  The union of triangles
!    coincides with the convex hull of the nodes, but triangles
!    in R can be distinguished from those outside of R.  The
!    only modification required to generalize the definition of
!    the Delaunay triangulation is replacement of property 5
!    (refer to TRMESH) by the following:
!
!    5')  If a node is contained in the interior of the 
!         circumcircle of a triangle, then every interior point
!         of the triangle is separated from the node by a
!         constraint arc.
!
!    In order to be explicit, we make the following definitions.  
!    A constraint region is the open interior of a
!    simple closed positively oriented polygonal curve defined
!    by an ordered sequence of three or more distinct nodes
!    (constraint nodes) P(1),P(2),...,P(K), such that P(I) is
!    adjacent to P(I+1) for I = 1,...,K with P(K+1) = P(1).
!    Thus, the constraint region is on the left (and may have
!    nonfinite area) as the sequence of constraint nodes is
!    traversed in the specified order.  The constraint regions
!    must not contain nodes and must not overlap.  The region
!    R is the convex hull of the nodes with constraint regions
!    excluded.
!
!    Note that the terms boundary node and boundary arc are
!    reserved for nodes and arcs on the boundary of the convex
!    hull of the nodes.
!
!    The algorithm is as follows:  given a triangulation
!    which includes one or more sets of constraint nodes, the
!    corresponding adjacencies (constraint arcs) are forced to
!    be present (Subroutine EDGE).  Any additional new arcs
!    required are chosen to be locally optimal (satisfy the
!    modified circumcircle property).

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NCC, the number of constraint curves 
!    (constraint regions).  0 <= NCC.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) LCC(NCC) (or dummy array of length 1 if 
!    NCC = 0) containing the index (for X, Y, and LEND) of the first node of 
!    constraint I in LCC(I) for I = 1 to NCC.  Thus, constraint I
!    contains K = LCC(I+1) - LCC(I) nodes, K >= 3, stored in (X,Y) 
!    locations LCC(I), ..., LCC(I+1)-1, where LCC(NCC+1) = N+1.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of nodes in the triangulation, 
!    including constraint nodes.  3 <= N.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), Y(N), the coordinates of the nodes with
!    non-constraint nodes in the first LCC(1)-1 locations, followed by NCC
!    sequences of constraint nodes.  Only one of these sequences may be
!    specified in clockwise order to represent an exterior constraint curve (a 
!    constraint region with nonfinite area).
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LWK.  On input, the length of IWK.  
!    This must be at least 2*NI where NI is the maximum number of arcs which 
!    intersect a constraint arc to be added.  NI is bounded by N-3.  On output,
!    the required length of IWK unless IER = 1 or IER = 3.  In the case of 
!    IER = 1, LWK is not altered from its input value.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IWK(LWK), the endpoint indexes of the new 
!    arcs which were swapped in by the last call to subroutine EDGE.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LIST(*), LPTR(*), LEND(N), the data 
!    structure defining the triangulation.  Refer to subroutine TRMESH.  On 
!    output, the structure has all constraint arcs present unless IER /= 0.  
!    These arrays are not altered if IER = 1.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IER = Error indicator:
!    0 if no errors were encountered.
!    1 if NCC, N, or an LCC entry is outside its valid range, or 
!      LWK < 0 on input.
!    2 if more space is required in IWK.
!    3 if the triangulation data structure is invalid, or failure (in 
!      EDGE or OPTIM) was caused by collinear nodes on the convex hull 
!      boundary.  An error message is written to logical unit 6 in
!      this case.
!    4 if intersecting constraint arcs were encountered.
!    5 if a constraint region contains a node.

!! ADDNOD adds a node to a triangulation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Given a triangulation of N nodes in the plane created by
!    subroutine TRMESH or TRMSHR, this subroutine updates the
!    data structure with the addition of a new node in position
!    K.  If node K is inserted into X and Y (K <= N) rather
!    than appended (K = N+1), then a corresponding insertion
!    must be performed in any additional arrays associated
!    with the nodes.  For example, an array of data values Z
!    must be shifted down to open up position K for the new
!    value:  set Z(I+1) to Z(I) for I = N,N-1,...,K.  For
!    optimal efficiency, new nodes should be appended whenever
!    possible.  Insertion is necessary, however, to add a non-
!    constraint node when constraints are present (refer to
!    subroutine ADDCST).
!
!    Note that a constraint node cannot be added by this
!    routine.  In order to insert a constraint node, it is
!    necessary to add the node with no constraints present
!    (call this routine with NCC = 0), update LCC by increment-
!    ing the appropriate entries, and then create (or restore)
!    the constraints by a call to ADDCST.
!
!    The algorithm consists of the following steps:  node K
!    is located relative to the triangulation (TRFIND), its
!    index is added to the data structure (INTADD or BDYADD),
!    and a sequence of swaps (SWPTST and SWAP) are applied to
!    the arcs opposite K so that all arcs incident on node K
!    and opposite node K (excluding constraint arcs) are local-
!    ly optimal (satisfy the circumcircle test).  Thus, if a
!    (constrained) Delaunay triangulation is input, a (con-
!    strained) Delaunay triangulation will result.  All indexes
!    are incremented as necessary for an insertion.

!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) IST, the index of a node at which TRFIND

!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NCC, the number of constraint curves.

!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LCC(*), list of constraint curve

!    subroutine ADDCST.  On output, starting indexes incremented by 1 to 
!    reflect the insertion of K unless NCC = 0 or (IER /= 0 and IER /= -4).
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of nodes in the 
!    triangulation.  3 <= N.  Note that N will be incremented following the 
!    addition of node K.

!    of the nodes in the first N positions with non-constraint nodes
!    in the first LCC(1)-1 locations if 0 < NCC.  On output, updated with
!    the insertion of XK and YK in the K-th positions (node I+1 was node 
!    I before the insertion for I = K to N if K <= N)
!    unless IER /= 0 and IER /= -4.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LIST(*), LPTR(*), LEND(N), LNEW, the

!    On output, updated with the addition of node K unless

!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IER = Error indicator:
!     0 if no errors were encountered.
!    -1 if K, IST, NCC, N, or an LCC entry is outside its valid range on input.

!! DELNOD deletes a node from a triangulation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This subroutine deletes node K (along with all arcs
!    incident on node K) from a triangulation of N nodes in the
!    plane, and inserts arcs as necessary to produce a triangu-
!    lation of the remaining N-1 nodes.  If a Delaunay triangu-
!    lation is input, a Delaunay triangulation will result, and
!    thus, DELNOD reverses the effect of a call to subroutine
!    ADDNOD.
!
!    Note that a constraint node cannot be deleted by this
!    routine.  In order to delete a constraint node, it is
!    necessary to call this routine with NCC = 0, decrement the
!    appropriate LCC entries (LCC(I) such that K < LCC(I) ), and
!    then create (or restore) the constraints by a call to sub-
!    routine ADDCST.
!
!    Note that the deletion may result in all remaining nodes
!    being collinear.  This situation is not flagged.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) K, the index (for X and Y) of the node to be
!    deleted.  1 <= K < LCC(1).  (K <= N if NCC=0).
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NCC, the number of constraint curves.  
!    0 <= NCC.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LCC(*), list of constraint curve 
!    starting indexes (or dummy array of length 1 if NCC = 0).  Refer to 
!    subroutine ADDCST.  On output, decremented by 1 to reflect the deletion 
!    of K unless NCC = 0 or 1 <= IER <= 4.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of nodes in the 
!    triangulation.  4 <= N.  Note that N will be decremented following the 
!    deletion.
!
!    Input/output, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), Y(N), the coordinates of the nodes
!    with non-constraint nodes in the first LCC(1)-1 locations if 0 < NCC.
!    On output, updated arrays of length N-1 containing nodal coordinates 
!    (with elements K+1,...,N shifted a position and thus overwriting 
!    element K) unless 1 <= IER <= 4.  (N here denotes the input value.)
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LIST(*), LPTR(*), LEND(N), LNEW, the 
!    data structure defining the triangulation.  Refer to subroutine TRMESH.
!    On output, updated to reflect the deletion unless IER /= 0.  Note
!    that the data structure may have been altered if 3 <= IER.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LWK.  On input, the number of columns 
!    reserved for IWK.  LWK must be at least NNB-3, where NNB is the number of
!    neighbors of node K, including an extra pseudo-node if K is a 
!    boundary node.  On output, the number of IWK columns required unless 
!    IER = 1 or IER = 3.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IWK(2,LWK), indexes of the endpoints of the 
!    new arcs added unless LWK = 0 or 1 <= IER <= 4.  (Arcs are associated with
!    columns, or pairs of adjacent elements if IWK is declared as a 
!    singly-subscripted array.)
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IER = Error indicator:
!    0, if no errors were encountered.
!    1, if K, NCC, N, or an LCC entry is outside its valid range or LWK < 0 
!      on input.
!    2, if more space is required in IWK.  Refer to LWK.
!    3, if the triangulation data structure is invalid on input.
!    4, if K is an interior node with 4 or more neighbors, and the number of
!      neighbors could not be reduced to 3 by swaps.  This could be caused by
!      floating point errors with collinear nodes or by an invalid data
!      structure.
!    5, if an error flag was returned by OPTIM.  An error message is written
!      to the standard output unit in this event.

!! EDGE swaps arcs to force two nodes to be adjacent.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Given a triangulation of N nodes and a pair of nodal
!    indexes IN1 and IN2, this routine swaps arcs as necessary
!    to force IN1 and IN2 to be adjacent.  Only arcs which
!    intersect IN1-IN2 are swapped out.  If a Delaunay triangu-
!    lation is input, the resulting triangulation is as close
!    as possible to a Delaunay triangulation in the sense that
!    all arcs other than IN1-IN2 are locally optimal.
!
!    A sequence of calls to EDGE may be used to force the
!    presence of a set of edges defining the boundary of a non-
!    convex and/or multiply connected region (refer to Subrou-
!    tine ADDCST), or to introduce barriers into the triangula-
!    tion.  Note that Subroutine GETNP will not necessarily
!    return closest nodes if the triangulation has been con-
!    strained by a call to EDGE.  However, this is appropriate
!    in some applications, such as triangle-based interpolation
!    on a nonconvex domain.

!! GETNP sets the next nearest node to a given node.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Given a triangulation of N nodes and an array NPTS con-
!    taining the indexes of L-1 nodes ordered by distance from
!    NPTS(1), this subroutine sets NPTS(L) to the index of the
!    next node in the sequence -- the node, other than NPTS(1),
!    ...,NPTS(L-1), which is closest to NPTS(1).  Thus, the
!    ordered sequence of K closest nodes to N1 (including N1)
!    may be determined by K-1 calls to GETNP with NPTS(1) = N1
!    and L = 2,3,...,K for K >= 2.  Note that NPTS must 
!    include constraint nodes as well as non-constraint nodes.
!    Thus, a sequence of K1 closest non-constraint nodes to N1
!    must be obtained as a subset of the closest K2 nodes to N1
!    for some K2 >= K1.
!
!    The terms closest and distance have special definitions
!    when constraint nodes are present in the triangulation.
!    Nodes N1 and N2 are said to be visible from each other if
!    and only if the line segment N1-N2 intersects no constraint
!    arc (except possibly itself) and is not an interi-
!    or constraint arc (arc whose interior lies in a constraint
!    region).  A path from N1 to N2 is an ordered sequence of
!    nodes, with N1 first and N2 last, such that adjacent path
!    elements are visible from each other.  The path length is
!    the sum of the Euclidean distances between adjacent path
!    nodes.  Finally, the distance from N1 to N2 is defined to
!    be the length of the shortest path from N1 to N2.
!
!    The algorithm uses the property of a Delaunay triangulation
!    that the K-th closest node to N1 is a neighbor of one
!    of the K-1 closest nodes to N1.  With the definition of
!    distance used here, this property holds when constraints
!    are present as long as non-constraint arcs are locally
!    optimal.

!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of nodes in the triangulation.  
!    N >= 3.

!! NEARND finds the nearest triangulation node to a point.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Given a point P in the plane and a Delaunay triangulation created by
!    subroutine TRMESH or TRMSHR, this function returns the index of the 
!    nearest triangulation node to P.
!
!    The algorithm consists of implicitly adding P to the
!    triangulation, finding the nearest neighbor to P, and
!    implicitly deleting P from the triangulation.  Thus, it
!    is based on the fact that, if P is a node in a Delaunay
!    triangulation, the nearest node to P is a neighbor of P.
!
!    Note that the number of candidates for NEARND
!    (neighbors of P) is limited to LMAX defined in
!    the PARAMETER statement below.

!! OPTIM optimizes the quadrilateral portion of a triangulation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Given a set of NA triangulation arcs, this subroutine
!    optimizes the portion of the triangulation consisting of
!    the quadrilaterals (pairs of adjacent triangles) which
!    have the arcs as diagonals by applying the circumcircle
!    test and appropriate swaps to the arcs.
!
!    An iteration consists of applying the swap test and
!    swaps to all NA arcs in the order in which they are
!    stored.  The iteration is repeated until no swap occurs
!    or NIT iterations have been performed.  The bound on the
!    number of iterations may be necessary to prevent an
!    infinite loop caused by cycling (reversing the effect of a
!    previous swap) due to floating point inaccuracy when four
!    or more nodes are nearly cocircular.

!! SWPTST applies the circumcircle test to a quadrilateral.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This function applies the circumcircle test to a quadri-
!    lateral defined by a pair of adjacent triangles.  The
!    diagonal arc (shared triangle side) should be swapped for
!    the other diagonl if and only if the fourth vertex is
!    strictly interior to the circumcircle of one of the
!    triangles (the decision is independent of the choice of
!    triangle).  Equivalently, the diagonal is chosen to maxi-
!    mize the smallest of the six interior angles over the two
!    pairs of possible triangles (the decision is for no swap
!    if the quadrilateral is not strictly convex).
!
!    When the four vertices are nearly cocircular (the
!    neutral case), the preferred decision is no swap -- in
!    order to avoid unnecessary swaps and, more important, to
!    avoid cycling in subroutine OPTIM which is called by
!    DELNOD and EDGE.  Thus, a tolerance SWTOL (stored in
!    SWPCOM by TRMESH or TRMSHR) is used to define 'nearness'
!    to the neutral case.

!    A Constrained Two-Dimensional Delaunay Triangulation Package,

!    Volume 22, Number 1, 1996.
!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NCC, the number of constraints.  NCC >= 0.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) LCC(*), list of constraint curve starting 
!    indexes (or dummy array of length 1 if NCC = 0).  Refer to subroutine 
!    ADDCST.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of nodes in the triangulation.  
!    N >= 3.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) LIST(*), LPTR(*), LEND(N), linked list data structure 
!    defining the triangulation.  Refer to subroutine TRMESH.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NROW, the number of rows (entries per triangle) 
!    reserved for the triangle list LTRI.  The value must be 6 if only 
!    the vertex indexes and neighboring triangle indexes are to be
!    stored, or 9 if arc indexes are also to be assigned and stored.  
!    Refer to LTRI.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) LTRI(NROW*NT), where NT is at most 2N-5.  (A 
!    sufficient length is 12 * N if NROW=6 or 18*N if NROW=9.)
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) NT, the number of triangles in the 
!    triangulation unless IER /= 0, in which case NT = 0.  NT = 2N - NB- 2, 
!    where NB is the number of boundary nodes.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LTRI(NROW,NT), whose J-th column contains the vertex nodal
!    indexes (first three rows), neighboring triangle indexes (second three
!    rows), and, if NROW = 9, arc indexes (last three rows) associated with
!    triangle J for J = 1,...,NT.  The vertices are ordered counterclockwise
!    with the first vertex taken to be the one with smallest index.  Thus,
!    LTRI(2,J) and LTRI(3,J) are larger than LTRI(1,J) and index adjacent
!    neighbors of node LTRI(1,J).  For I = 1,2,3, LTRI(I+3,J) and LTRI(I+6,J)
!    index the triangle and arc, respectively, which are opposite (not shared
!    by) node LTRI(I,J), with LTRI(I+3,J) = 0 if LTRI(I+6,J) indexes a boundary
!    arc.  Vertex indexes range from 1 to N, triangle indexes from 0 to NT,
!    and, if included, arc indexes from 1 to NA = NT+N-1.  The triangles are 
!    ordered on first (smallest) vertex indexes, except that the sets of
!    constraint triangle (triangles contained in the closure of a constraint
!    region) follow the non-constraint triangles.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LCT(NCC), containing the triangle index of the first
!    triangle of constraint J in LCT(J).  Thus, the number of non-constraint
!    triangles is LCT(1)-1, and constraint J contains LCT(J+1)-LCT(J) 
!    triangles, where LCT(NCC+1) = NT+1.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IER = Error indicator.
!    0, if no errors were encountered.
!    1, if NCC, N, NROW, or an LCC entry is outside its valid range on input.
!    2, if the triangulation data structure (LIST,LPTR,LEND) is invalid.  
!
!  Local Parameters:
!
!    ARCS = TRUE iff arc indexes are to be stored.
!    KA,KT = Numbers of currently stored arcs and triangles.
!    N1ST = Starting index for the loop on nodes (N1ST = 1 on
!           pass 1, and N1ST = LCC1 on pass 2).
!    NM2 = Upper bound on candidates for N1.
!    PASS2 = TRUE iff constraint triangles are to be stored.

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! TRMESH triangulates a set of points in the plane.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This subroutine creates a Delaunay triangulation of a
!    set of N arbitrarily distributed points in the plane
!    referred to as nodes.  The Delaunay triangulation is defined
!    as a set of triangles with the following five properties:
!
!    1)  The triangle vertices are nodes.
!    2)  No triangle contains a node other than its vertices.
!    3)  The interiors of the triangles are pairwise disjoint.
!    4)  The union of triangles is the convex hull of the set
!        of nodes (the smallest convex set which contains
!        the nodes).
!    5)  The interior of the circumcircle of each triangle
!        contains no node.
!
!    The first four properties define a triangulation, and the
!    last property results in a triangulation which is as close
!    as possible to equiangular in a certain sense and which is
!    uniquely defined unless four or more nodes lie on a common
!    circle.  This property makes the triangulation well-suited
!    for solving closest point problems and for triangle-based
!    interpolation.
!
!    The triangulation can be generalized to a constrained
!    Delaunay triangulation by a call to Subroutine ADDCST.
!    This allows for user-specified boundaries defining a non-
!    convex and/or multiply connected region.
!
!    The algorithm for constructing the triangulation has
!    expected time complexity O(N*log(N)) for most nodal dis-
!    tributions.  Also, since the algorithm proceeds by adding
!    nodes incrementally, the triangulation may be updated with
!    the addition (or deletion) of a node very efficiently.
!    The adjacency information representing the triangulation
!    is stored as a linked list requiring approximately 13N
!    storage locations.
!
!
!    The following is a list of the software package modules
!    which a user may wish to call directly:
!
!    ADDCST - Generalizes the Delaunay triangulation to allow
!             for user-specified constraints.
!
!    ADDNOD - Updates the triangulation by appending or
!             inserting a new node.
!
!    AREAP  - Computes the area bounded by a closed polygonal
!             curve such as the boundary of the triangula-
!             tion or of a constraint region.
!
!    BNODES - Returns an array containing the indexes of the
!             boundary nodes in counterclockwise order.
!             Counts of boundary nodes, triangles, and arcs
!             are also returned.
!
!    CIRCUM - Computes the area, circumcenter, circumradius,
!             and, optionally, the aspect ratio of a trian-
!             gle defined by user-specified vertices.
!
!    DELARC - Deletes a boundary arc from the triangulation.
!
!    DELNOD - Updates the triangulation with the deletion of a
!             node.
!
!    EDGE   - Forces a pair of nodes to be connected by an arc
!             in the triangulation.
!

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of nodes in the triangulation.  
!    N >= 3.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), Y(N), the coordinates of the nodes. 
!    (X(K),Y(K)) is referred to as node K, and K is referred to as a nodal
!    index.  The first three nodes must not be collinear.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LIST(6*N-12), nodal indexes which, along with LPTR,
!    LEND, and LNEW, define the triangulation as a set of N adjacency 
!    lists; counterclockwise-ordered sequences of neighboring nodes such
!    that the first and last neighbors of a boundary node are boundary 
!    nodes (the first neighbor of an interior node is arbitrary).  In
!    order to distinguish between interior and boundary nodes, the last 
!    neighbor of each boundary node is represented by the negative
!    of its index.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LPTR(6*N-12), pointers (LIST indexes) in 
!    one-to-one correspondence with the elements of LIST.  LIST(LPTR(I)) 
!    indexes the node which follows LIST(I) in cyclical counterclockwise order
!    (the first neighbor follows the last neighbor).
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LEND(N), pointers to adjacency lists.  LEND(K)
!    points to the last neighbor of node K for K = 1,...,N.  Thus, 
!    LIST(LEND(K)) < 0 if and only if K is a boundary node.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) LNEW, pointer to the first empty location in LIST
!    and LPTR (list length plus one).  LIST, LPTR, LEND, and LNEW are 
!    not altered if IER < 0, and are incomplete if IER > 0.
!
!    Workspace NEAR(N), NEXT(N), DIST(N).  The space is used to efficiently
!    determine the nearest triangulation node to each unprocessed node for 
!    use by ADDNOD.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IER = Error indicator:
!     0 if no errors were encountered.
!    -1 if N < 3 on input.
!    -2 if the first three nodes are collinear.
!    -4 if an error flag was returned by a call to SWAP in ADDNOD.  This is 
!      an internal error and should be reported to the programmer.
!     L if nodes L and M coincide for some M > L.  The linked list represents
!      a triangulation of nodes 1 to M-1 in this case.
!
!  Local parameters:
!
!    D =        Squared distance from node K to node I

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! TRMSHR triangulates logically rectangular data.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This subroutine creates a Delaunay triangulation of a
!    set of N nodes in the plane, where the nodes are the vert-
!    ices of an NX by NY skewed rectangular grid with the
!    natural ordering.  Thus, N = NX*NY, and the nodes are
!    ordered from left to right beginning at the top row so
!    that adjacent nodes have indexes which differ by 1 in the
!    x-direction and by NX in the y-direction.  A skewed rec-
!    tangular grid is defined as one in which each grid cell is
!    a strictly convex quadrilateral (and is thus the convex
!    hull of its four vertices).  Equivalently, any transfor-
!    mation from a rectangle to a grid cell which is bilinear
!    in both components has an invertible Jacobian.
!
!    If the nodes are not distributed and ordered as defined
!    above, Subroutine TRMESH must be called in place of this
!    routine.  Refer to Subroutine ADDCST for the treatment of
!    constraints.
!
!    The first phase of the algorithm consists of construc-
!    ting a triangulation by choosing a diagonal arc in each
!    grid cell.  If NIT = 0, all diagonals connect lower left
!    to upper right corners and no error checking or additional
!    computation is performed.  Otherwise, each diagonal arc is
!    chosen to be locally optimal, and boundary arcs are added
!    where necessary in order to cover the convex hull of the
!    nodes.  (This is the first iteration.)  If NIT > 1 and no
!    error was detected, the triangulation is then optimized by
!    a sequence of up to NIT-1 iterations in which interior
!    arcs of the triangulation are tested and swapped if appro-
!    priate.  The algorithm terminates when an iteration
!    results in no swaps and/or when the allowable number of
!    iterations has been performed.  NIT = 0 is sufficient to
!    produce a Delaunay triangulation if the original grid is
!    actually rectangular, and NIT = 1 is sufficient if it is
!    close to rectangular.  Note, however, that the ordering
!    and distribution of nodes is not checked for validity in
!    the case NIT = 0, and the triangulation will not be valid
!    unless the rectangular grid covers the convex hull of the
!    nodes.

!! TRMTST tests a data structure representing a Delaunay triangulation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This subroutine tests the validity of the data structure
!    representing a Delaunay triangulation created by subrou-
!    tine TRMESH.  The following properties are tested:
!
!    1)  Each interior node has at least three neighbors, and
!        each boundary node has at least two neighbors.
!
!    2)  abs ( LIST(LP) ) is a valid nodal index in the range
!        1 to N and LIST(LP) > 0 unless LP = LEND(K) for some
!        nodal index K.
!
!    3)  Each pointer LEND(K) for K = 1 to N and LPTR(LP) for
!        LP = 1 to LNEW-1 is a valid LIST index in the range
!        1 to LNEW-1.
!
!    4)  N .GE. NB .GE. 3, NT = 2*N-NB-2, and NA = 3*N-NB-3 =
!        (LNEW-1)/2, where NB, NT, and NA are the numbers of
!        boundary nodes, triangles, and arcs, respectively.
!
!    5)  Each circumcircle defined by the vertices of a tri-
!        angle contains no nodes in its interior.  This prop-
!        erty distinguishes a Delaunay triangulation from an
!        arbitrary triangulation of the nodes.
!
!    Note that no test is made for the property that a triangulation 
!    covers the convex hull of the nodes.

!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), Y(N), the nodal coordinates.

!    containing the triangulation.  Refer to subroutine TRMESH.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) TOL, nonnegative tolerance to allow for
!    floating-point errors in the circumcircle test.  An error situation
!    is defined as 
!      (R**2 - D**2) / R**2 > TOL, 
!    where R is the radius of a circumcircle and D is the distance from the

!    10*EPS, where EPS is the machine precision.  The test is effectively
!    bypassed by making TOL large.  If TOL < 0, the tolerance is taken 
!    to be 0.

!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) ARMAX, maximum aspect ratio (radius of inscribed
!    circle divided by circumradius) of a triangle in the triangulation 
!    unless 0 < IER.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IER = Error indicator:
!    -1 if one or more null triangles (area = 0) are present but no (other)
!      errors were encountered.  A null triangle is an error only if it 
!      occurs in the the interior.
!     0 if no errors or null triangles were encountered.

!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) LIST(*), LPTR(*), LEND(N), data structure 
!    defining the triangulation.  Refer to subroutine TRMESH.
!
!    Input, character ( len = * ) TITLE, a string to be centered above the 
!    plot.  The string must be enclosed in parentheses; i.e., the first and 
!    last characters must be '(' and ')', respectively, but these are not
!    displayed.  TITLE may have at most 80 characters including the parentheses.
!
!    Input, logical NUMBR, option indicator:  If NUMBR = TRUE, the

!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IER = Error indicator:

!! TRPRNT prints information about a planar triangulation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Given a triangulation of a set of points in the plane,
!    this subroutine prints the adjacency lists and, optionally, 
!    the nodal coordinates.  The list of neighbors of a boundary 
!    node is followed by index 0.  The numbers of boundary nodes, 
!    triangles, and arcs, and the constraint curve starting indexes, 
!    if any, are also printed.
