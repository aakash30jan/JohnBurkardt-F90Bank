CVTP_PRB
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the CVTP library.
 
TEST01
  CVTP can compute a periodic Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation
  We set MODULAR to TRUE to do this.
 
  Spatial dimension M =                   2
  Number of generators =                400
  MODULAR arithmetic option =  T
  Initial random number seed =    123456789
  Number of sample points =    100000
  Number of sample steps =         50
 
TEST02
  CVTP can compute a periodic Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation.
  But here, we turn modularity OFF.
 
  Spatial dimension M =                   2
  Number of generators =                400
  MODULAR arithmetic option =  F
  Initial random number seed =    123456789
  Number of sample points =    100000
  Number of sample steps =         50
 
CVTP_PRB
  Normal end of execution.
