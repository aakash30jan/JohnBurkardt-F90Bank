HAMMERSLEY_DATASET (FORTRAN90 version)
  Generate a Hammersley dataset.
 
  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.
 
  The program requests input values from the user:
 
  * NDIM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * STEP, the index of the first subsequence element.
  * SEED(1:NDIM), the sequence element
    corresponding to STEP = 0
  * LEAP(1:NDIM), the successive jumps in the sequence.
  * BASE(1:NDIM), the bases, usually distinct primes
    or -N (to generate values like J/N).
 
  The program generates the data, writes it to the file
 
    hammersley_NDIM_N.txt
 
  where "NDIM" and "N" are the numeric values specified
  by the user, and then asks the user for more input.
 
  To indicate that no further computations are 
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value, 
  such as -1.

  Enter NDIM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try "2" if you have no preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input NDIM =            2
 
  Enter N, the number of points to generate:
  (Try "25" if you have no preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input N =           20
 
  Enter STEP, the index of the first subsequence element:
  (Try "0" or "1" if you have no preference.)
  (Any negative value terminates execution).
  User input STEP =            0
 
  Enter SEED(1:NDIM), the sequence index
  corresponding to STEP = 0
  (Try "0 0 ... 0" if you have no preference.)
  (a negative value terminates execution.)
  User input            1           0
 
  Enter LEAP(1:NDIM), the jumps in the sequence.
  (Try "1 1 ... 1" if you have no preference.)
  (another choice is any prime larger than all bases.)
  (any value less than 1 terminates execution.)
  User input            1           1
 
  Enter BASE(1:NDIM), the bases, usually distinct
  primes, but any NEGATIVE base generates 
  values J/|BASE|.
  (Try "-N 2 3 5 7 11 ..." if you have no preference.)
  (any value of 0 or 1 terminates execution.)
  User input          -10           2
 
  The data was written to the file "hammersley_02_00020.txt".

  The input value of NDIM =           -1
  is interpreted as a request for termination.
  Normal end of execution.
