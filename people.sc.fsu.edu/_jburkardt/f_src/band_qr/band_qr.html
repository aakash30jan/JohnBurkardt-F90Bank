    <p>
      <b>BAND_QR</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      includes LAPACK-style routines to compute the QR factorization
      of a banded matrix, 
      by Alfredo Remon, Enrique Quintana-Orti, Gregorio Quintana-Orti.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distinguishing features of these routines include the fact
      that
      <ul>
        <li>
          they accept the banded matrix in the compact "GB"
          ("General Banded") format
        </li>
        <li>
          the QR factors are also stored compactly, by overwriting
          the input matrix storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          large problems are handled efficiently by taking advantage
          of the blocked version of the algorithm.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The routines, as originally developed, did not include a routine to
      solve linear systems A*x=b once the QR factors had been computed.
      A routine DGBBQRS() has been written to carry out this computation
      in cases where the QR factors were computed using DGBBQR2(),
      that is, the unblocked code.
