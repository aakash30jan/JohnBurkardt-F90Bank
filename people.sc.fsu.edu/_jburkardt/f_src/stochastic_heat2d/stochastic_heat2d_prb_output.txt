STOCHASTIC_HEAT2D_PRB:
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the STOCHASTIC_HEAT2D library.

TEST01:
  Consider the steady heat equation in the unit square,
  with 0 Dirichlet boundary conditions, 
  and a heat source term F that is a Gaussian centered at (0.60,0.80).

  Model the diffusivity coefficient as spatially varying,
  with a stochastic dependence on parameters OMEGA(1:4),
  as described in Babuska, Nobile, Tempone (BNT).

  Compute and display the solution U for a given choice
  of the parameters OMEGA.
 
  Sampled OMEGA values:
 
         1:    3.3580805    
         2:  -0.94553760    
         3:   -1.1321196    
         4:  -0.46224826    
 
  Created graphics data file "solution_data.txt".
  Created graphics command file "solution_commands.txt".
 
  Mean value of U is   0.337698    

TEST02:
  Fix OMEGA(3) = 4, OMEGA(4) = 0, and
  examine dependence of average temperature on OMEGA(1) and OMEGA(2)
  over the range [-10,+10].

  Omega(3) fixed at    4.00000    
  Omega(4) fixed at    0.00000    
 
  Created graphics data file "umean_data.txt".
  Created graphics command file "umean_commands.txt".

  U_Mean_Max =   0.641953    

STOCHASTIC_HEAT2D_PRB:
  Normal end of execution.
