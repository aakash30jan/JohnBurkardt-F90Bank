      REFORMAT <br> Rewrite a Text File With Fixed Number of Words Per Line
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>REFORMAT</b> is a FORTRAN90 program
      which reads an ASCII text file,
      and writes a copy, with the property that every line (except
      perhaps the last one) has the same number of values on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program was "inspired" by a situation in which the data in
      a file was not arranged as expected.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was assumed that there were 4 items in every line.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in fact, a free format had been used, and the system "felt free"
      to write 3 values per line, resulting in a ragged file of lines
     of alternating lengths of 3 and 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      One can easily imagine other cases where 11 values would be written
      as 3/3/3/2.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if the system had used another limit for the number of values
      per line, we would find that L values had been written as
      M/M/M/M/N instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of this program is allow for the repair of these
      "mistakes" in the simplest case.  Thus, we imagine the command
      <pre><code>
        reformat ragged.txt smooth.txt 4
      </code></pre>
      would read data from the file "ragged.txt", and write it out 4 words
      at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my experience, it has always been the case that several lines
      of the ragged file always exactly equaled one line of the smooth
      file.  But it is easy to imagine more complicated situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reasonable thing to do, I think, is to interpret the command
      as an attempt to get ALL the information in the ragged file into
      the smooth file, using the fixed limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      This decision means the program can also be used to take a
      file of four words per line and turn it into one of 3 words per line.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version of the program is only able to deal with files that
      contain nothing but real numbers.  For a version that works with
      abstract 'words', see REWORD below.

          <i>output</i> is the file to create;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>length</i> is the number of values on each line of the output file.
