      INT_EXACTNESS <br> Exactness of One Dimensional Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>INT_EXACTNESS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of a one dimensional
      quadrature rule defined on a finite interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        Although this program was intended for use with 1D rules, it
        should also work for quadrature rules defined for multiple dimensions.
        The spatial dimension is inferred from the form of the "X" file
        that is one of the input quadrature files.  See the last example
        for a demonstration of the use of this program for a 2D quadrature rule.
        See the companion program <b>NINT_EXACTNESS</b> for a program
        that was explicitly intended for use in multiple dimensions.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      The polynomial exactness of a quadrature rule is defined as the
      highest degree <b>D</b> such that the quadrature rule is
      guaranteed to integrate exactly all polynomials of degree
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> or less, ignoring roundoff.  The degree of a polynomial
      is the maximum of the degrees of all its monomial terms.  The degree
      of a monomial term is the exponent.  Thus, for instance,
      the <b>DEGREE</b> of
      <blockquote><b>
        3*x<sup>5</sup> - 7*x<sup>9</sup> + 27
      </b></blockquote>
      is the maximum of 5, 9 and 0, so it is 9.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be thorough, the program starts at <b>DEGREE</b> = 0, and then
      proceeds to <b>DEGREE</b> = 1, 2, and so on up to a maximum degree
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> specified by the user.  At each value of <b>DEGREE</b>,
      the program generates the corresponding monomial term, applies the
      quadrature rule to it, and determines the quadrature error.  The program
      uses a scaling factor on each monomial so that the exact integral
      should always be 1; therefore, each reported error can be compared
      on a fixed scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is very flexible and interactive.  The quadrature rule
      is defined by three files, to be read at input, and the
      maximum degree is specified by the user as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the three files that define the quadrature rule
      are assumed to have related names, of the form
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      When running the program, the user only enters the common <i>prefix</i>
      part of the file names, which is enough information for the program
      to find all three files.
    </p>

    <p>
      For information on the form of these files, see the
      <b>QUADRATURE_RULES</b> directory listed below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exactness results are written to an output file with the
      corresponding name:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>exact.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>int_exactness</b> <i>prefix</i> <i>degree_max</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i> is the common prefix for the files containing the abscissa, weight
          and region information of the quadrature rule;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>degree_max</i> is the maximum monomial degree to check.  This would normally be
          a relatively small nonnegative number, such as 5, 10 or 15.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the arguments are not supplied on the command line, the
      program will prompt for them.
