      ZIGGURAT_OPENMP <br> Using the ZIGGURAT Library with OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ZIGGURAT_OPENMP</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 library which 
      explores how the ZIGGURAT library may be used, in conjunction with
      OpenMP, to compute random numbers efficiently and correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary worry, when computing random numbers in OpenMP, 
      occurs when the user calls a random number generator which may
      have some internal memory.  In that case, the internal memory
      may become corrupted if multiple threads are invoking the code
      at the same time.  
    </p>

    <p>
      A safe way to compute random numbers is to ensure that the
      seed value, and any other data or tables needed by the computation,
      are stored externally, in the user program.  That way, each thread
      can have a separate copy of the data, and multiple threads of random number
      calculations can be going along simultaneously without fear
      of overwriting or memory contention.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program presented here is somewhat awkward, because it wishes
      to verify that OpenMP can compute exactly the same data as a sequential
      program.  To do so, we need to create separate seeds for each threads,
      and ensure that the threads execute the loop iterations in some predictable
      sequence.  When the sequential program goes through the same calculations,
      we again have to do some acrobatics to ensure that it is doing the
      same things that the parallel program did.
    </p>

    <p>
      So some of the complications in this program are there to ensure that
      we can exhibit the same results sequentially and in parallel.  Once
      you are convinced of that, and see how to go about this, your own
      program can be set up without some of the overhead and special
      instructions used in this demonstration.
    </p>

    <p>
      On an Apple PowerPC G5 with two processors, the following results were
      observed:
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th>Threads</th><th>Test01</th><th>Test02</th><th>Test03</th><th>Test04</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>0.592 s</td><td>1.240 s</td><td>1.579 s</td><td>1.478 s</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td><td>0.315 s</td><td>0.638 s</td><td>0.791 s</td><td>0.796 s</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td><td>0.303 s</td><td>0.635 s</td><td>0.826 s</td><td>0.773 s</td>
        </tr>
      </table> 
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      In the BASH shell, the program could be run with 2 threads using the commands:
      <pre>
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
        ./ziggurat_openmp
      </pre>
