#
#    800 flow solutions from INOUT_FLOW2
#
#    Preprocessing:
#    * Solutions 1-400 we subtract 5/3 of steady.txt
#    * Solutions 401-800 we subtract 1/3 of steady.txt
#    * We do NOT normalize each result.
#
#  Our run type is 9.

NONE
#
#  The range of cluster sizes to examine.  Because these values are
#  equal, the program knows we don't want to study a bunch of values,
#  but rather generate the data for one size and write them to a file.
