    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_BASIS_FLOW</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      extracts representative solution
      modes of a set of solutions to a fluid flow PDE.
    </p>

    <p>
      The selection process uses K-Means clustering, which can be considered
      to be a discrete version of the CVT algorithm (Centroidal Voronoi
      Tessellation).
    </p>

    <p>
      The selected modes will generally be "well spread out" in the space
      spanned by the set of solutions.  Such a set of modes might be useful
      as a basis for a low-dimensional approximation of new solutions,
      as long as it may be assumed that these new solutions do not
      have significant components that were not evident
      in the original solution data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, a partial differential equation (PDE) has been
      defined, specifying the time dependent flow of a fluid through
      a region.  The PDE specification includes a parameter ALPHA
      whose value strongly affects the behavior of the flow.  The
      steady state solution S0 is computed for a particular value
      of ALPHA.  Then the time dependent problem is solved over a
      fixed time interval, with ALPHA varying from time to time.
      A set of several hundred solutions S(T(I),ALPHA(I)) are saved.
    </p>

    <p>
      The need is to try to extract from this solution data the
      typical modes of behavior of the solution.  Such a set of modes
      may then be used as a finite element basis that is highly tuned
      to the physics of the problem, so that a very small set of
      basis functions can be used to closely approximate the behavior
      of the solution over a range of values of ALPHA.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method of extracting information from the solution data
      uses a form of K-Means clustering.
      The program will try to cluster the data, that is, to organize
      the data by defining a number of cluster centers, which are
      also points in N dimensional space, and assigning each record
      to the cluster associated with a particular center.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method of assigning data aims to minimize the cluster energy,
      which is taken to be the sum of the squares of the distances of
      each data point from its cluster center.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some contexts, it makes sense to use the usual Euclidean sort
      of distance.  In others, it may make more sense to replace each
      data record by a normalized version, and to assign distance
      by computing angles between the unit vectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the data comes from a finite element computation, and
      the results may be used as a new reduced basis, it may be
      desirable to carry out mass matrix preconditioning of the data,
      so that output vectors (cluster generators) are pairwise orthogonal
      in the L2 inner product (integration of the product of the finite
      element functions over the domain).
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the results may be used as a new reduced basis, it may be
      desirable, once the results have been computed, to apply a
      Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, so that the basis
      vectors have unit Euclidean norm, and are pairwise orthogonal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current version of the program assumes that a steady state
      solution <b>SS</b> of the PDE is known, and that a multiple
      of SS is to be subtracted from each solution vector before processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>FILES</b>: the program assumes the existence of the following files:
      (the actual names of the files are specified by the user at run time.
      The names used here are just suggestions.)
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>xy.txt</i>, contains the coordinates of each node, with
          one pair of coordinates per line of the file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>ss.txt</i>, contains the steady state solution values at each
          node; normally, there are two values per node (horizontal and
          vertical velocity).  However, the program will accept data
          that is scalar, or with a higher number of components than 2.
          Most of the ensuing discussion assumes that the number of
          components is 2, but that's just because that is the problem
          we are usually working on;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>uv01.txt</i>, <i>uv02.txt</i>, ..., contains the solution values
          at each node for solution 1, 2, and so on; the number of components
          (normally 2) must be the same as for the steady state solution
          file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>element.txt</i>, contains the indices of the six nodes that
          make up each element, with one set of six indices per line of
          the file <i>(only needed if mass matrix
          preconditioning is used)</i>;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>INPUT</b>: at run time, the user specifies:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>run_type</i> describes how we subtract off the steady state,
          whether we drop some data, and other options.  The current
          values range from 1 to 8.  The most common value is 6, used
          with the TCELL data:
          <ol>
            <li>
              no steady state file is used, no preprocessing is carried out;
            </li>
            <li>
              no steady state file is used, no preprocessing is carried out;
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 1/3 SS from solution 1, 5/3 SS from solutions
              2 to 201, and 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 1/3 SS from solution 1, 5/3 SS from solutions
              2 to 201, and 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401,
              and drop the even-numbered data.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 1/3 SS from solution 1, 5/3 SS from solutions
              2 to 201, and 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401,
              and skip half the data and normalize it.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 5/3 SS from solutions
              1 to 250, and 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500, do not
              normalize.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 5/3 SS from solutions
              1 to 250, and 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500,
              normalize the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              subtract 5/3 SS from solutions
              1 to 250, and 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500, then
              drop the odd-numbered data, do not
              normalize.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>xy_file</i>, the name of the <b>xy</b> file containing the
          node coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>steady_file</i>, the name of the steady state solution file,
          or "none" if the data does not need to be preprocessed (run_type
          1 or 2);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>uv0_file</i>, the name of the first solution file (the program
          will assume all the files are numbered consecutively).
          <b>The code has been modified so that you may now specify more
          than one set of solution families.  Enter "none" if there are
          no more families, or else the name of the first file in the
          next family.  Up to 10 separate families of files are allowed.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>cluster_lo, cluster_hi</i>, the range of cluster sizes to check.
          In most cases, you simply want to specify the <b>same number</b>
          for both these values, namely, the requested basis size.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>cluster_it_max</i>, the number of different times you want to
          try to cluster the data; I often use 15.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>energy_it_max</i>, the number of times you want to try to improve
          a given clustering by swapping points from one cluster to another;
          I often use 50 or 100.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>element_file</i>, the name of the element file, if mass matrix
          preconditioning is desired, or else "none".
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>normal</i>, 0 to use raw data, 1 to normalize; here, after
          we have subtracted the steady state and preconditioned the data
          vectors, we are offering also to make each data vector have
          unit norm before clustering.  At the moment, I'm working with
          the raw data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>comment</i>, "Y" if initial comments may be included in the
          beginning of the output files.  These comments always start with
          a "#" character in column 1.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>OUTPUT</b>: the program computes <b>basis_num</b> basis vectors.
      The first vector is written to the file <i>gen_001.txt</i>; again,
      the output vectors are written with two values per line, since
      this represents the two components of velocity at a particular
      node.

          The program calls numerous LAPACK routines for the processing
          of the mass matrix.  The text for these routines is not included
          in the source code.  The compiled program must be linked to
          the LAPACK library.
