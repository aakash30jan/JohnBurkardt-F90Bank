CVT_BASIS_FLOW
  FORTRAN90 version
  Arrange a set of PDE solution data into clusters.
 
  This NEW version of the code handles up to
    10 families of data.
 
  Null cluster policy:
  0, do nothing, accept null clusters;
  1, reset center to a random data point;
  2, reset center to random point in hull;
 
  NULL_CLUSTER_POLICY =      1
 
RANDOM_INITIALIZE
  Initialize RANDOM_NUMBER with user SEED =    123456789
 
  The variable RUN_TYPE determines preprocessing:
 
* 1, NO steady state file, no preprocessing;
 
* 2, NO steady state file, no preprocessing;
 
* 3,    steady state file;
    subtract 1/3 SS from solution  1
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 2 through 201
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
    do NOT normalize the data.
    use all the data.
 
* 4,    steady state file;
    subtract 1/3 SS from solution  1
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 2 through 201
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
    do NOT normalize the data;
    then discard the EVEN numbered data files.
 
* 5,    steady state file;
    subtract 1/3 SS from solution  1
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 2 through 201
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 202 through 401.
    then NORMALIZE the data;
    use all the data.
 
* 6,    steady state file;
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
    do NOT normalize the data.
    use all the data.
 
* 7,    steady state file;
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
    then NORMALIZE the data;
    use all the data.
 
* 8,    steady state file;
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
    do NOT normalize the data.
    then discard the ODD numbered data files.
 
* 9,    steady state file;
    subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 400
    subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 401 through 800.
    do NOT normalize the data.
    use all the data.
 
What is the run type (1 through 9)?
 
  RUN_TYPE =      6
 
  What is the XY data file name (or NONE)?
 
  The file "/home/jburkardt/public_html/datasets/tcell_flow/xy.txt" contains the coordinates of 4961 with spatial dimension 2.
 
  X minimum :    0.00000    
  X maximum :    1.00000    
  Y minimum :    0.00000    
  Y maximum :    1.00000    
 
What is the name of the steady state file or "none"?
 
  Steady state information was read from
  the file "/home/jburkardt/public_html/datasets/tcell_flow/steady.txt".
 
  It is time to read sets of solution files.
 
  We assume that a series of solution files exists,
  with "consecutive" names, like
    fred001.txt, fred002,txt, ...
  Just specify the FIRST name in the series, and
  the program will read them all.
 
  The program can read another series of data if
  you specify yet another first name, or you can
  type "none" when there are no more file series.
 
 
What is the first solution file (in the first series)?
 
What is the first solution file (in the NEXT series) or "NONE"?
 
  The number of initial solution files is      1
  The total number of solution files is    500
 
  The data is stored in an M by N matrix.
 
  The "spatial" dimension M is     9922
  The number of data points N is    500
 
 
  Processing files starting with "/home/jburkardt/public_html/datasets/tcell_flow/up001.txt".
 
  All the data has been read into POINT.
 
Enter lower and upper number of clusters
 DEBUG: CLUSTER_LO =            4  cluster_hi =            4
 
  The program will try to determine the minimum energy
  of a clustering, for cluster sizes in the range:
       4     4
 
Enter the number of different random cluster configurations to check
 
  For each number of clusters, the number of
  distinct initial random configurations to be checked
  will be      15
 
Enter the number of energy iterations
 
  For each initial random configuration, the number of
  times the program will recompute the cluster centers,
  cluster components, and energy is     30
 
Enter element file for mass matrix preconditioning or "none".
 
Enter 0 to use raw data, 1 to use normalized data.
 
NORMAL = 0
  Data will NOT be normalized.
 
Number of clusters allowed:      4
