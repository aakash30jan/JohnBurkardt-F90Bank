#
#    500 flow solutions in the CAVITY.
#
#    Preprocessing:
#    * Solutions 1-250 we subtract 5/3 of steady.txt
#    * Solutions 251-500 we subtract 1/3 of steady.txt
#    * Then we drop the ODD steps.
#    * We don't normalize each result.
#
#  Our run type is 8.

/a/fs/r1/src-samples/datasets/cavity_flow/steady.txt
#
#  The name of the first solution file in the first series.

/a/fs/r1/src-samples/datasets/cavity_flow/up001.txt
#
#  The name of the first solution file in the next series.
#
NONE
#
#  The range of cluster sizes to examine.  Because these values are
#  equal, the program knows we don't want to study a bunch of values,
#  but rather generate the data for one size and write them to a file.

8, 8
#
#  The number of different random initial configurations to check.

15
#
#  The number of energy iterations to take.
