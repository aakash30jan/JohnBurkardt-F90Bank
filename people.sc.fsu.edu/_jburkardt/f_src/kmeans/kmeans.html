      KMEANS <br> the K-Means Data Clustering Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>KMEANS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      handles the K-Means problem,
      which organizes a set of N points in M dimensions into K clusters;
    </p>

    <p>
      In the K-Means problem, a set of N points X(I) in M-dimensions is
      given.  The goal is to arrange these points into K clusters,
      with each cluster having a representative point Z(J), usually
      chosen as the centroid of the points in the cluster.  <pre>
        Z(J) = Sum ( all X(I) in cluster J ) X(I) /
               Sum ( all X(I) in cluster J ) 1.
      </pre>
      The energy of cluster J is <pre>
        E(J) = Sum ( all X(I) in cluster J ) || X(I) - Z(J) ||^2
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a given set of clusters, the total energy is then simply
      the sum of the cluster energies E(J).  The goal is to choose the
      clusters in such a way that the total energy is minimized.
      Usually, a point X(I) goes into the cluster with the closest
      representative point Z(J).  So to define the clusters, it's
      enough simply to specify the locations of the cluster representatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is actually a fairly hard problem.  Most algorithms do
      reasonably well, but cannot guarantee that the best solution
      has been found.  It is very common for algorithms to get
      stuck at a solution which is merely a "local minimum".
      For such a local minimum, every slight rearrangement of
      the solution makes the energy go up; however a major
      rearrangement would result in a big drop in energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple algorithm for the problem is known as the "H-Means algorithm".
      It alternates between two procedures:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Using the given cluster centers, assign each point to the
          cluster with the nearest center;
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the given cluster assignments, replace each cluster
          center by the centroid or average of the points in the cluster.
        </li>
      </ul>
      These steps are repeated until no points are moved, or some
      other termination criterion is reached.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more sophisticated algorithm, known as the "K-Means algorithm",
      takes advantage of the fact that it is possible to quickly determine
      the decrease in energy caused by moving a point from its current cluster
      to another.  It repeats the following procedure:
      <ul>
        <li>
          For each point, move it to another cluster if that would lower
          the energy.  If you move a point, immediately update the
          cluster centers of the two affected clusters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This procedure is repeated until no points are moved, or some
      other termination criterion is reached.

      The Weighted K-Means Problem
    </h3>

    <p>
      A natural extension of the K-Means problem allows us to include
      some more information, namely, a set of <i>weights</i> associated
      with the data points.  These might represent a measure of importance,
      a frequency count, or some other information.  The intent is that
      a point with a weight of 5.0 is twice as "important" as a point with
      a weight of 2.5, for instance.  This gives rise to the "weighted"
      K-Means problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <i>weighted K-Means problem</i>, we are given a set of N points
      X(I) in M-dimensions, and a corresponding set of nonnegative weights
      W(I).  The goal is to arrange the points into K clusters,
      with each cluster having a representative point Z(J), usually
      chosen as the weighted centroid of the points in the cluster: <pre>
        Z(J) = Sum ( all X(I) in cluster J ) W(I) * X(I) /
               Sum ( all X(I) in cluster J ) W(I).
      </pre>
      The weighted energy of cluster J is <pre>
        E(J) = Sum ( all X(I) in cluster J ) W(I) * || X(I) - Z(J) ||^2
      </pre>
