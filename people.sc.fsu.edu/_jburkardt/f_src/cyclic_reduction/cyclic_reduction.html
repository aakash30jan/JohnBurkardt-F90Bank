      CYCLIC_REDUCTION <br> A Direct Solution Method for Tridiagonal Linear Systems.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CYCLIC_REDUCTION</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      applies the cyclic reduction method to solve a tridiagonal system of
      linear equations A*x=b.
    </p>

    <p>
      The matrix is assumed to be diagonally dominant - that is, for every row,
      we require that the magnitude of the diagonal entry be at least as great
      as the sum of the magnitudes of the two off-diagonal elements.  This is
      (just barely) true for the "-1, 2, -1" matrix, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other methods for solving tridiagonal linear systems include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gauss elimination with pivoting;
        </li>
        <li>
          the Thomas algorithm, (Gauss elimination without pivoting);
        </li>
        <li>
          the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR iterative methods;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Cyclic reduction is a form of Gauss elimination.  It proceeds by first
      eliminating half of the variables simultaneously, then half of the remainder,
      and so on.  This amounts to more work, but the work in each elimination
      step can be done in parallel.  Thus, unlike the Gauss and Thomas algorithms,
      cyclic reduction offers a procedure for the direct solution of a tridiagonal
      linear system that can take advantage of parallelism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cyclic reduction can also be adapted to the block tridiagonal linear systems
      that arise when Poisson's equation is discretized over a 2D region.
