    </h3>

    <p>
      The following challenge appeared in an advertistement in 
      the New York Times, 14 June 2007:
      <blockquote><i>
        "Dear Ketel One Drinker: Can you make one hundred words, of four letters
        or more, from the letters in Ketel One Vodka?"
      </i></blockquote>
      To answer the question, a program was written, which searched
      a text file.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "ketel_one.f90">ketel_one.f90</a>, the source code;

          <a href = "ketel_one.txt">ketel_one.txt</a>,
          the 514 "subanagrams" that were found by the program.  Some of
          these are proper names, or dubious words.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "ketel_one_jtb.txt">ketel_one_jtb.txt</a>,

        <li>
          <a href = "ketel_one_byhand.txt">ketel_one_byhand.txt</a>,

      LOCK
    </h3>

    <p>
      The "lock" puzzle is posed in
      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/fun/puzzles/lock_puzzle.html">The Lock Puzzle</a>.
      My nephew Logan called to say he was stuck on a puzzle in a video game.
      He was facing a lock which had four dials, and he needed to change the
      current combination to a specified one.  The trick was that the dials
      affected their neighbors.  Turning dial 1 would turn dial 2 the same amount.
      Turning dial 2 or dial 3 also turned the immediate left and right neighbors,
      while dial 4 also made dial 3 turn.  This complication made it difficult
      to see how to go from a combination of, say, 1492, to a target of 1234.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "lock.f90">lock.f90</a>, 
          the source code for a program that simulates the lock problem with
          random start and target;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "lock_solve.f90">lock_solve.f90</a>, 
          a program that accepts a current and desired combination, and
          reports the amount to advance each dial to achieve the target.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      THIRTY ONE
    </h3>

    <p>
      The "thirty one" puzzle is posed in
      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/fun/puzzles/thirty_one_puzzle.html">
      The Thirty One Puzzle</a>.  A tableau of 24 cards is laid out, consisting
      of 4 copies of each number from 1 to 6.  Two players alternate in selecting
      a card from the tableau.  As a card is chosen by either player, its face
      value is added to the total.  If a player's choice causes the total to
      reach exactly 31, that player wins.  If a player's choice increases the
      total past 31, the game is a draw.  The program given here allows the
      user to play the first player, which the program plays the second player.
      The program analyzes its next move to see if it has a win, or if its move
      would allow the user to win immediately.  The program was written by
      Yuen-Yick Kwan.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "thirty_one.f90">thirty_one.f90</a>, the source code;
