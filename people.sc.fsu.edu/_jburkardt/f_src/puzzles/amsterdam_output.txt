AMSTERDAM
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Work on the "AMSTERDAM" problem.
 
  As in the iPhone application Textropolis,
  find as many words as possible using the letters 
  in "AMSTERDAM".
 
  Examine a file "wordlist.txt"
  full of words, and look for "sub-anagrams" 
  (words whose letters are a subset of the target ones).
 
  We only consider words of length at least        4
 
  Copy sub-anagrams to "amsterdam.txt".
  
   Number of words checked                        300249
   Number of words that were "long enough"        298499
   Number of sub-anagrams found                      269
 
AMSTERDAM:
  Normal end of execution.
