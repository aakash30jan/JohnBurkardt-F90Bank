      F90_MODULE <br> Using the FORTRAN90 Module Statement
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>F90_MODULE</b>
      is a directory of FORTRAN90 programs which
      illustrate the use of the FORTRAN90 module statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      For programmers familiar with older versions of FORTRAN, the module
      statement was an attempt. in part, to provide the functionality of the 
      "common block" and the "include statement", while doing so in a 
      cleaner, safer way, which also eased the use of
      certain other features of modern programming such as encapsulation,
      prescribed and checkable interfaces, and public/private data and functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my opinion, the module statement is inadequate, poorly designed,
      documented, and implemented, and a regrettable further step down the
      road of making every single program a byzantine, inaccessible and
      unalterable labyrinth that compiles and runs for one set of data
      and one user under one compiler on one computer.  Nonetheless,
      occasionally I have to use the module statement, or help other people
      who are using it, and for that reason I have thought a little about
      how it works.

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>DUCK</b> shows that, when multiple files are to be compiled,
      files defining modules must be compiled BEFORE files that invoke
      those modules.  (This example was run on a Linux system, with the
      gfortran compiler.  Its behavior, and the auxilliary files it
      creates, may vary in other environments.)  (By the way, this example
      disclosed to me the appalling fact that if a function is defined
      in a module, then the type of the function must NOT be explicitly
      declared in any other procedures within the module, nor within 
      any external procedure that "uses" the module, because in some
      vague and undocumented way, the module definition includes what
      amounts to a definition of the type of the function.  Of course,
      for all I know, this behavior may also vary from compiler to compiler.)
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "duck.f90">duck.f90</a>, defines a module called "duck"
          containing subroutines flink and plink, and function grink.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "duck_prb.f90">duck_prb.f90</a>, a program which
          says "include duck".
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "duck_prb_output.txt">duck_prb_output.txt</a>,
          the output file;
