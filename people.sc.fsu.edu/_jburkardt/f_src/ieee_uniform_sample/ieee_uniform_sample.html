      IEEE_UNIFORM_SAMPLE <br> Uniform Sampling of IEEE Values
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IEEE_UNIFORM_SAMPLE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      samples uniformly from the IEEE numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike usual random number generators, which attempt to sample
      uniformly over a range of real numbers, this library treats the
      set of IEEE numbers as a discrete set, and randomly samples them.
      The results are very different from a uniform random number sample.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are as many IEEE values in the interval (A,B) and the interval
      (1/B,1/A).  This seems fine, and we need this to be so in order to
      have multiplicative inverses.  But it also means that there are as many
      numbers between 1/1,000,000 and 1 as there are between 1 and 1,000,000.
      Since the IEEE values are naturally weighted by 2, a better way to think
      of this is that if there are N values between 1 and 2, then there are
      also N values between 2 and 4, 4 and 8, 1024 and 2048, one million and
      2 million, 2 millionths and 1 millionth, and so on.  The density function
      for the IEEE values looks like a power function 2^(-x).
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's ignore the "bizarre" IEEE numbers, which include <b>Inf</b>,
      <b>NaN</b> and the denormalized numbers (very very small values).
      For 32 bit real numbers, this
      leaves us with numbers that can be described by a 1 bit sign,
      an 8 bit exponent biased by 127, and a 23 bit mantissa with an
      implicit leading 1 and an implicit divisor of 2^23.
    </p>

    <p>
      Except when a "bizarre" creature would be created, every random
      sequence of 32 0's and 1's creates a legal IEEE value.  So to sample
      from the IEEE set of values, we can simply create random strings of
      0's and 1's.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current routines are very preliminary, and even so aren't working
      all that well.  However, the idea makes sense, and once some details
      are worked out, it should be easy to extend this approach to double precision
      values, or to allow the user to specify a "model" IEEE implementation in
      which the exponent and mantissa range have been modified.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not aware of any serious purpose to which this library could be put,
      but it does, I think, help in trying to understand that strange structure
      of the discrete set of numbers that underly almost all of our computations,
      and that do a reasonably good job of mimicking a continuous range of
      real values.
