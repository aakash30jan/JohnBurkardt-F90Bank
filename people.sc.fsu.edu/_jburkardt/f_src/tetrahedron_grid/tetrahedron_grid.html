    <p>
      <b>TETRAHEDRON_GRID</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      generates a grid of points 
      over the interior of a tetrahedron in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting with any 4 points A, B, C and D that define a tetrahedron,
      we can divide each edge of the tetrahedron into N subintervals,
      and create a tetrahedral grid.  This defines ((N+1)*(N+2)*(N+3))/6
      points that lie on the intersections of grid lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes a routine which allows the user to pick an
      arbitrary tetrahedron and an arbitrary number of subdivisions.  It
      then returns the tetrahedral gridpoints defined by that choice.
