      HERMITE_EXACTNESS <br> Exactness of Gauss-Hermite Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HERMITE_EXACTNESS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Hermite
      quadrature rule for the infinite interval (-oo,+oo).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Gauss Hermite quadrature assumes that the integrand we are
      considering has a form like:
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) f(x) * rho(x) dx
      </pre>
      where <b>rho(x)</b> is regarded as a weight factor.
    </p>

    <p>
      We consider variations of the rule, depending on the
      form of the weight factor rho(x):
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 0, the unweighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho(x) = 1
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 1, the physicist weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho(x) = exp(-x*x)
          </pre>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 2, the probabilist weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho(x) = exp(-x*x/2)
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 3, the physicist normalized weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho(x) = exp(-x*x) / sqrt(pi)
          </pre>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 4, the probabilist normalized weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho(x) = exp(-x*x/2) / sqrt(2 pi)
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding Gauss-Hermite rule that uses <b>order</b> points
      will approximate the integral by
      <pre>
        sum ( 1 &lt;= i &lt;= order ) w(i) * f(x(i))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      When using a Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule, it's important to know whether
      the rule has been developed for the unweighted, physicist weighted,
      probabilist weighted, physicist normalized weighted, or
      probabilist normalized cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      For an unweighted Gauss-Hermite rule, polynomial exactness may be defined
      by assuming that <b>f(x)</b> has the form </b>f(x) = exp(-x*x) * x^n</b> for some
      nonnegative integer exponent <b>n</b>.  We say an unweighted Gauss-Hermite rule
      is exact for polynomials up to degree DEGREE_MAX if the quadrature rule will
      produce the correct value of the integrals of such integrands for all
      exponents <b>n</b> from 0 to <b>DEGREE_MAX</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a physicist or probabilist weighted Gauss-Hermite rules, polynomial exactness
      may be defined by assuming that <b>f(x)</b> has the form </b>f(x) = x^n</b> for some
      nonnegative integer exponent <b>n</b>.  We say the physicist or probabilist
      weighted Gauss-Hermite rule is exact for polynomials up to degree DEGREE_MAX
      if the quadrature rule will produce the correct value of the integrals of such
      integrands for all exponents <b>n</b> from 0 to <b>DEGREE_MAX</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To test the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule of
      one of these forms, the program starts at <b>n</b> = 0, and then
      proceeds to <b>n</b> = 1, 2, and so on up to a maximum degree
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> specified by the user.  At each value of <b>n</b>,
      the program generates the appropriate corresponding integrand function
      (either <b>exp(-x*x)*x^n</b> or <b>x^n</b>), applies the
      quadrature rule to it, and determines the quadrature error.  The program
      uses a scaling factor on each monomial so that the exact integral
      should always be 1; therefore, each reported error can be compared
      on a fixed scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is very flexible and interactive.  The quadrature rule
      is defined by three files, to be read at input, and the
      maximum degree to be checked is specified by the user as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the three files that define the quadrature rule
      are assumed to have related names, of the form
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      When running the program, the user only enters the common <i>prefix</i>
      part of the file names, which is enough information for the program
      to find all three files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that when approximating these kinds of integrals, or even when
      evaluating an exact formula for these integrals, numerical inaccuracies
      can become overwhelming.  The formula for the exact integral of
      <b>x^n*exp(-x*x)</b> (which we use to test for polynomial exactness)
      involves the double factorial function, which "blows up" almost as
      fast as the ordinary factorial.  Thus, even for formulas of order
      16, where we would like to consider monomials up to degree 31, the
      evaluation of the exact formula loses significant accuracy.
