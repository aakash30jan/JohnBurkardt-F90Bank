      ASA172 <br> Generation of all multi-indices in a given range
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>ASA172</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 library which 
      generates all multidimensional indices in a given range.
      simulating the behavior of an arbitrary number of nested loops,
      by OFlaherty and MacKenzie.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the number of dimensions was known in advance, such an operation could
      be carried out by the corresponding set of nested loops.  For example, in 3D:
      <pre>
        do i = i1, i2
          do j = j1, j2
            do k = k1, k2
              (I,J,K) is an index in the range.
            end do
          end do
        end do
      </pre>
      One feature of this library, though, is that it can generate all such indexes
      for an arbitrary number of dimensions.
