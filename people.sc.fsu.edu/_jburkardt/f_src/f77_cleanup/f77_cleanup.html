      F77_CLEANUP <br> Minor Cleanups to a FORTRAN77 File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>F77_CLEANUP</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      makes some minor cleanups to the text of a FORTRAN77 file.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, in the revised program:
      <ul>
        <li>
          TAB characters are replaced by six spaces;
        </li>
        <li>
          all comments begin with a lowercase "c";
        </li>
        <li>
          all continuation characters are "&";
        </li>
        <li>
          trailing blanks are trimmed;
        </li>
        <li>
          all (noncomment) lines are no longer than 72 characters.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>f77_cleanup</b> <i>input.f77</i> <i>output.f77</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the file <i>file.f77</i> and creates a copy <i>output.f77</i>
          with cleanups.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <a href = "https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/catalog/catalog.html">
      CATALOG</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 program and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.

    <p>
      <a href = "../extract/extract.html">
      EXTRACT</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      extracts a subroutine, function or module by name from a
      FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 file.

    <p>
      <a href = "../f90split/f90split.html">

      HTMLINDEX</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 file and writes a skeleton
      HTML page describing it, assuming that each routine includes
      a specially marked description line.

      INCLUDE_FILES</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
