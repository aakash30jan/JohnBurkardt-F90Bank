    <p>
      <b>STRIPACK_BENCH</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      times the execution of STRIPACK's Delaunay triangulation procedure
      on a sequence of sets of random nodes of increasing size.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program was run with a sequence of increasing values of N,
      with these results:
