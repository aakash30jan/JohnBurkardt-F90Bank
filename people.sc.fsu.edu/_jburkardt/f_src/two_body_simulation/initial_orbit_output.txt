INITIAL_ORBIT
  FORTRAN90 version
  This simulation follows a small body for two orbits
  around a relatively massive body - such as Mercury around
  the sun.
  Kepler's equations for a two body system are used.
  Note that the orbit is NOT an ellipse.  But that's OK,
  because the planet is far from its equilibrium orbit.
 
  Use RKF45 for the ODE integrator.
  Created data file "initial_orbit_data.txt".
  Created command file "initial_orbit_commands.txt".
