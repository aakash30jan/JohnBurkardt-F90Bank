ORBITAL_DECAY
  FORTRAN90 version
  This simulation follows a small body for 20 orbits
  around a relatively massive body - such as Mercury around
  the sun.
  Kepler's equations for a two body system are used.
  Initially, the orbit is NOT an ellipse, but as time passes,
  the orbit decays into an elliptical shape.
 
  Use RKF45 for the ODE integrator.
