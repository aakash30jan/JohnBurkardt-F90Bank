    <p>
      <b>WEDGE_GRID</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of the unit wedge in 3D.
    </p>

     <p>
      The interior of the unit wedge in 3D is defined by the constraints:
      <pre>
        0 <= X
        0 <= Y
             X + Y <= 1
       -1 <= Z <= +1
      </pre>
