    <p>
      <b>F90_CALLS_C++_AND_MPI</b>
      is a directory of FORTRAN90 programs which
      illustrate the use of the MPI Message Passing Interface
      in situations in which a C++ function is involved in the calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that this example takes advantage of the ISO C binding
      module, which was actually only introduced into the FORTRAN standard
      as part of FORTRAN 2003.  Your compiler may be willing to let your
      FORTRAN90 program access it.  If not, you might consider moving to
      FORTRAN 2003!.

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>QUAD</b> estimates an integral by evaluating a function at N points.
      Under MPI, P processes are used, each of which evaluates the function at N/P
      points, and the results are combined.  In this example, the main program
      sets up MPI, but then calls an underlying function to compute the partial
      results.  This function is written in C++.  The Intel IFORT FORTRAN compiler 
      we are using automatically appends an underscore to function names, so in 
      the C++ code we have explicitly added an underscore to the end of the C++ function that
      is called by the FORTRAN90 main program (because I didn't feel like looking
      up the FORTRAN90 compiler option to suppress the underscore addition).
      <ul>
        <li>

          the main program.
