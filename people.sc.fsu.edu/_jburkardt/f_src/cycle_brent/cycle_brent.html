    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CYCLE_BRENT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      analyzes a cycle in an iterated function sequence using Brent's method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we a repeatedly apply a function f(), starting with the argument
      x0, then f(x0), f(f(x0)) and so on.  Suppose that the range of f is finite.
      Then eventually the iteration must reach a cycle.  Once the cycle is reached,
      succeeding values stay within that cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting at x0, there is a "nearest element" of the cycle, which is
      reached after MU applications of f.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the cycle is entered, the cycle has a length LAM, which is the number
      of steps required to first return to a given value.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function uses Brent's method to determine the values of MU and LAM,
      given F and X0.
