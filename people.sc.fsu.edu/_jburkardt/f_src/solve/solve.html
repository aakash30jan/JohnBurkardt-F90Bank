      SOLVE <br> Linear Solver for Double Dimensioned Arrays
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SOLVE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      solves a linear system of equations A*x=b using Gauss elimination.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many automatic ways to solve linear systems, as in MATLAB,
      and sophisticated packages such as LAPACK.  However, this simpler
      set of routines may have some uses for students, beginners and those
      who need a quick and simple solver that can be replaced later if
      it turns out to be inadequate.
    </p>

    <p>
      This library is useful because:
      <ul>
        <li>
          it shows the steps involved in a simple Gauss-elimination procedure;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used to count the number of operations in Gauss-elimination;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a guide for writing a corresponding program
          in another language;
        </li>
        <li>
          its performance can be compared to corresponding versions in C
          or Fortran;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a starting point for exploring band storage,
          sparse storage, iterative solutions and other topics in linear 
          algebra.
        </li>
      </ul>
