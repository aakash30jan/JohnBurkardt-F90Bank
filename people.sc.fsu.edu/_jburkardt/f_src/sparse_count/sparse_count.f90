!! CC_ME_SIZE: Clenshaw Curtis, Moderate Exponential Growth.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The Clenshaw-Curtis-Moderate family assumes that, for the underlying 1D
!    rules, a precision of 4*L+1 is needed at level L.  Therefore, the
!    lowest possible order Clenshaw-Curtis rule is chosen that will achieve
!    that precision.
!
!    The grid is defined as the sum of the product rules whose LEVEL
!    satisfies:
!
!      0 <= LEVEL <= LEVEL_MAX.
!
!    This calculation is much faster than a previous method.  It simply
!    computes the number of new points that are added at each level in the
!    1D rule, and then counts the new points at a given DIM_NUM dimensional
!    level vector as the product of the new points added in each dimension.

!! COMP_NEXT computes the compositions of the integer N into K parts.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    A composition of the integer N into K parts is an ordered sequence
!    of K nonnegative integers which sum to N.  The compositions (1,2,1)
!    and (1,1,2) are considered to be distinct.
!
!    The routine computes one composition on each call until there are no more.
!    For instance, one composition of 6 into 3 parts is
!    3+2+1, another would be 6+0+0.
!
!    On the first call to this routine, set MORE = FALSE.  The routine
!    will compute the first element in the sequence of compositions, and
!    return it, as well as setting MORE = TRUE.  If more compositions
!    are desired, call again, and again.  Each time, the routine will
!    return with a new composition.
!
!    However, when the LAST composition in the sequence is computed
!    and returned, the routine will reset MORE to FALSE, signaling that
!    the end of the sequence has been reached.
!
!    This routine originally used a SAVE statement to maintain the
!    variables H and T.  I have decided that it is safer
!    to pass these variables as arguments, even though the user should
!    never alter them.  This allows this routine to safely shuffle
!    between several ongoing calculations.
!
!
!    There are 28 compositions of 6 into three parts.  This routine will
!    produce those compositions in the following order:
!
!     I         A
!     -     ---------
!     1     6   0   0
!     2     5   1   0

!    underlying 1D rules, a precision of 2*L+1 is needed at level L.  Therefore,
!    the lowest possible order Gauss-Patterson rule is chosen that will achieve
!    that precision.  This retains a combination of the advantages of
!    nestedness and high accuracy.
!
!    The grid is defined as the sum of the product rules whose LEVEL
!    satisfies:
!
!      0 <= LEVEL <= LEVEL_MAX.
!
!    This calculation is much faster than a previous method.  It simply
!    computes the number of new points that are added at each level in the
!    1D rule, and then counts the new points at a given DIM_NUM dimensional
!    level vector as the product of the new points added in each dimension.

!! OWN_O_SIZE: Open Weakly Nested, Odd Growth.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This calculation assumes that an odd growth rule is being used,
!    that is, that the 1D rules have orders 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9,
!    and so on.
!
!    This repetition of rules is permissible because the sparse grid rule
!    only requires that the 1D rule of level L have precision at least 2*L+1,
!    which is achievable for Gaussian rules.
