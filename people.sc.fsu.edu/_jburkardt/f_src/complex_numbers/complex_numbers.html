      COMPLEX_NUMBERS <br> Complex Numbers in FORTRAN90 Programming
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COMPLEX_NUMBERS</b> is a FORTRAN90 program which
      demonstrates very briefly some of the features of using complex
      numbers in a FORTRAN90 program. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first issue is how to declare a complex variable, including
      the choice of single precision or double precision, whether
      the variable is a scalar, vector, or array, and whether the variable
      is initialized with a value, or assigned one.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second issue concerns the question of how a complex variable is
      to be printed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns how a complex variable is to operated on
      by the arithmetic operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      division, and exponentiation.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The language also provides a number of intrinsic functions that
      can be applied to a complex variable.  The names of these functions
      can sometimes be easy to forget.  Moreover, it is occasionally true
      that there may be a selection of functions with similar names
      (say, "exp", "cexp" and "dcexp") which may or may not produce the
      desired results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns the details of double precision calculation.
      Even a single accidental use of a single precision function name
      in a double precision computation can result in the loss of half
      the digits of accuracy.  Thus, it sometimes really matters whether
      you use "cmplx" or "dcmplx" to assign values to a double precision
      complex variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      A peculiar feature of FORTRAN90 is that the generic <b>cmplx()</b> function
      will produce a result whose real and imaginary parts are single precision,
      no matter what the type of the input arguments or the target output value.
      The only ways to avoid this are to add the <b>kind=</b> qualifier, as in
      <blockquote>
        a = cmplx ( b, c, kind = 8 )
      </blockquote>
      or to use the dcmplx() function specific to double precision:
      <blockquote>
        a = dcmplx ( b, c )
      </blockquote>
