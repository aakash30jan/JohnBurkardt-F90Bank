      COMMUNICATOR_MPI <br> Creating New Communicators in MPI
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COMMUNICATOR_MPI</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which 
      creates new communicators involving a subset of initial
      set of MPI processes in the default communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD.
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand this program, let's assume we run it under MPI with
      4 processes.  Within the default communicator, the processes will
      have ID's of 0, 1, 2 and 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can call MPI_Comm_group() to request that a "group id" be 
      created from MPI_COMM_WORLD.  Then we call MPI_Group_incl(),
      passing a list of a subset of the legal process ID's in MPI_COMM_WORLD,
      to be identified as a new group.  In particular, we'll pass the even
      ID's, creating an even group, and later create an odd group in the same
      way.
    </p>

    <p>
      A group ID can be used to create a new communicator, calling
      MPI_Comm_create().  Once we have this new communicator, we
      can use functions like MPI_Comm_Rank() and MPI_Comm_Size(),
      specifying the name of the new communicator.  We then can use
      a function like MPI_Reduce() to sum up data associated exclusively
      with the processes in that communicator.
    </p>

    <p>
      One complicating factor is that a process that is not part of
      the new communicator cannot make an MPI call that invokes that
      communicator.  For instance, an odd process could not call
      MPI_Comm_rank() asking for its rank in the even communicator.
      If you look at the program, you will see that we have to be 
      careful to determine what group we are in before we make
      calls to the MPI routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, in the example, we could begin with 4 processes, whose
      global ID's are 0, 1, 2 and 3.  We create an even communicator
      containing processes 0 and 2, and an odd communicator with 1 and 3.
      Notice that, within the even communicator, the processes with
      global ID's 0 and 2 have even communicator ID's of 0 and 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can call MPI_Reduce() to sum the global ID's of the processes
      in the even communicator, getting a result of 2; the same sum,
      over the odd communicator, results in 4.
