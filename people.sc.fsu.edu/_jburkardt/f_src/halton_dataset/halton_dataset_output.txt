HALTON_DATASET (FORTRAN90 version)
  Generate a Halton dataset.
 
  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.
 
  The program requests input values from the user:
 
  * NDIM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * STEP, the index of the first subsequence element.
  * SEED(1:NDIM), the Halton sequence element
    corresponding to STEP = 0
  * LEAP(1:NDIM), the successive jumps in the 
    Halton sequence.
  * BASE(1:NDIM), the Halton bases,
    usually distinct primes.
 
  The program generates the data, writes it to the file
 
    halton_NDIM_N.txt
 
  where "NDIM" and "N" are the numeric values specified
  by the user, and then asks the user for more input.
 
  To indicate that no further computations are 
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value, 
  such as -1.

  Enter NDIM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try "2" if you do not have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input NDIM =            2
 
  Enter N, the number of points to generate:
  (Try "25" if you do not have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input N =           10
 
  Enter STEP, the index of the first subsequence element:
  (Try "0" or "1" if you do not have a preference.)
  (Any negative value terminates execution).
  User input STEP =            0
 
  Enter SEED(1:NDIM), the Halton sequence index
  corresponding to STEP = 0
  (Try "0 0 ... 0" if you do not have a preference).
  (a negative value terminates execution.)
  User input            1           1
 
  Enter LEAP(1:NDIM), the successive jumps in 
  the Halton sequence.
  (Try "1 1 ... 1" if you do not have a preference).
  (another choice is any prime larger than all bases.)
  (any value less than 1 terminates execution.)
  User input            1           1
 
  Enter BASE(1:NDIM), the Halton bases,
  usually distinct primes.
  (Try "2 3 5 7 11 13 ..." if you do not have a preference).
  (any value 1 or less terminates execution.)
  User input            2           3
 
  The data was written to the file "halton_02_00010.txt".
