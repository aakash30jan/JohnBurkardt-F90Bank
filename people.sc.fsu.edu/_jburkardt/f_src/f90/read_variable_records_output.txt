READ_VARIABLE_RECORDS:
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  Demonstrate how to read an unknown number of values.
  Although the number of values is unknown, we will
  assume that the formatting of the values is fixed.
  In particular, we will here assume that each
  record of the file contains integers in the I4 format.
 
  It turns out that the first integer will indicate
  the number of remaining data items on the line,
  but we won't actually use that fact.
