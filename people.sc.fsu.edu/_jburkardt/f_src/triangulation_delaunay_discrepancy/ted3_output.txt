TRIANGULATION_DELAUNAY_DISCREPANCY
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Read a node dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangulation dataset of 
  TRIANGLE_NUM triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.
 
  Determine the Delaunay discrepancy, that is, the amount
  by which the minimum angle in the triangulation could be
  changed by a single adjustment of a pair of triangles.
 
  If this discrepancy is negative, 
  then the triangulation is not a Delaunay triangulation.
 
  If this discrepancy is 0 or essentially so, 
  then the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.
