GFARIT
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  A program which computes a set of arithmetic
  tables, and writes them to a file.
 
  Tables will be created for prime and prime-power fields
  with orders Q = 2 through Q =       50
 
  GFTAB computing table for Q =        4  characteristic P =        2
  GFTAB computing table for Q =        8  characteristic P =        2
  GFTAB computing table for Q =        9  characteristic P =        3
  GFTAB computing table for Q =       16  characteristic P =        2
  GFTAB computing table for Q =       25  characteristic P =        5
  GFTAB computing table for Q =       27  characteristic P =        3
  GFTAB computing table for Q =       32  characteristic P =        2
  GFTAB computing table for Q =       49  characteristic P =        7
