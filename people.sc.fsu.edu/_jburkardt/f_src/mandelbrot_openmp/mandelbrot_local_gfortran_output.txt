MANDELBROT_OPEN_MP
  FORTRAN90/OpenMP version
 
  Create an ASCII PPM image of the Mandelbrot set.
 
  For each point C = X + i*Y
  with X range [  -2.25000    ,   1.25000    ]
  and  Y range [  -1.75000    ,   1.75000    ]
  carry out     2000 iterations of the map
  Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C.
  If the iterates stay bounded (norm less than 2)
  then C is taken to be a member of the set.
 
  An ASCII PPM image of the set is created using
    M =      500 pixels in the X direction and
    N =      500 pixels in the Y direction.
 
  Time =   0.626832    
 
  Graphics data written to "mandelbrot.ppm".
 
MANDELBROT_OPEN_MP
  Normal end of execution.
