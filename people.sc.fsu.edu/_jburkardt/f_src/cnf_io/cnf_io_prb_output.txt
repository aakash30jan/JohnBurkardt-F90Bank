CNF_IO_PRB
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the CNF_IO library.
 
TEST01
  CNF_WRITE can write CNF data to a CNF file.
 
  Here is the data:
 
CNF data printout:
 
  The number of variables       V_NUM  =        3
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  =        2
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  =        5
 
  Clause        1 includes        2 signed literals
   1
  -3
 
  Clause        2 includes        3 signed literals
   2
   3
  -1
 
  Now we call CNF_WRITE to store this information
  in the file "cnf_io_v3_c2.cnf".
 
TEST02
  CNF_HEADER_READ reads the header of a CNF file.
 
  Read the header of "cnf_io_v3_c2.cnf".
 
  The number of variables       V_NUM  =        3
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  =        2
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  =        5
 
TEST03
  CNF_DATA_READ reads the data of a CNF file.
 
  Read the header of "cnf_io_v3_c2.cnf".
 
  The number of variables       V_NUM  =        3
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  =        2
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  =        5
 
  Here is the data as read from the file:
