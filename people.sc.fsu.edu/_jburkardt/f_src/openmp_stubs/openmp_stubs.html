      OPENMP_STUBS <br> A FORTRAN90 Stub Library for OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>OPENMP_STUBS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      constitutes a stub implementation of the OpenMP standard for
      shared memory parallel programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      A stub library is useful when you want to try out a program on a system
      that does not have OpenMP, or when you need to have a formally complete
      program to analyze, or in other cases where you want to ignore the actual
      OpenMP library.  A stub library can also help to understand the structure
      of the actual library.

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <i>
        Note that these examples are normally run in parallel with OpenMP.
        The point being made here is that such programs can be run sequentially,
        as though OpenMP were available, by calling the OPENMP_STUBS library.
        They don't run well (fast) - it's just remarkable that they run at all.

      <b>COMPUTE_PI</b> shows how information can be shared.
      Several processors need to compute pieces of a sum that will
      approximate pi.

    <p>
      <b>HELLO</b> is a very simple program which calls an
      OpenMP subroutine to set the number of threads, and then has
      each thread say hello;
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "../openmp/hello.html">hello.f90</a>,

        Again, please don't be confused.  These routines have the same names
        as the real OpenMP library; they just don't do anything.  Well, not much,
        anyway.  They do just enough to let a program run in sequential mode.
