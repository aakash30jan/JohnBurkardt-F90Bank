      MULTIGRID_POISSON_1D <br> Multigrid Solver for 1D Poisson Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MULTIGRID_POISSON_1D</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      applies a multigrid method to solve the linear system associated
      with a discretized version of the 1D Poisson equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 1D Poisson equation is assumed to have the form
      <pre>
        -u''(x) = f(x), for a < x < b
         u(a) = ua, u(b) = ub
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let K be a small positive integer called the mesh index, and let
      N = 2^K be the corresponding number of uniform subintervals into which
      [A,B] is divided.  Assigning a value U(I) to each of the N+1 equally
      spaced nodes with coordinate X(I), we approximate the equation by
      <pre>
        -U(i-1) + 2 U(i) - U(i+1)
        -------------------------   = f( X(i) ), 1 < I < N+1
                  h^2

        U(1) = ua, U(N+1) = ub.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      It remains to solve the linear system for the desired values of U.
      This could be done directly, or iteratively.  An iterative method
      such as Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel or SOR might be suitable, but experience
      shows that the convergence rate of these iterative methods decreases
      drastically as the value of K is increased - that is, as a more
      refined and accurate answer is sought.
    </p>

    <p>
      The multigrid method defines a nested set of grids, and corresponding
      solutions, to the problem, and applies an iterative linear solver.
      By transfering information from one grid to a finer or coarser one,
      a more rapid convergence behavior can be encouraged.
