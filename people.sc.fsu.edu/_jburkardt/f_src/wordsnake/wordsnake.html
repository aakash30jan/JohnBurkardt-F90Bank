      WORDSNAKE <br> Seek High Scoring Wordsnakes
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>WORDSNAKE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program
      which tries to find a good solution to the "Wordsnake Puzzle".
    <p>

    <p>
      WORDSNAKE is given a list of words and tries to arrange them
      in a list so that the end of one word has maximum overlap with the
      beginning of the next word.  The entire list is called a "wordsnake",
      and is scored by squaring the overlaps of each consecutive pair, and
      adding.  We allow the wordsnake to "wraparound", so there's one extra
      score for overlap from the last word to the first.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>wordsnake</b> <i>wordlist</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>wordlist</i> is a file containing a list of words,
          one per line, to be made into a wordsnake.
        </dd>
      </ul>
