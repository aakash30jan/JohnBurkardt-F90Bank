PARTIAL_DIGEST_PRB:
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the PARTIAL_DIGEST library.
  
 TEST01
   PARTIAL_DIGEST_RECUR generates solutions to the partial
   digest problem, using recursion
 
  The number of objects to place is N =        5
 
  The original placement was 0,3,6,8,10.
  These placements generate the following distances:
 
  Distance array:
 
         1             2
         2             2
         3             3
         4             3
         5             4
         6             5
         7             6
         8             7
         9             8
        10            10
 
  PARTIAL_DIGEST_RECUR may recover the original placements
  from the pairwise distances.  It may also find other
  placements that have the same distance array.
 
  Solution:
 
         1             0
         2            10
         3             8
         4             3
         5             6
 
  Solution:
 
         1             0
         2            10
         3             2
         4             7
         5             4
